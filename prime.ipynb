       "'The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect\\nA Novel by Roger Williams\\n \\n  This page contains the entire text of all eight chap ters.\\n* Chapter One: \\n  Caroline At Play\\nHer name was Caroline Frances Hubert, and she had t hree\\nclaims to fame.\\nIn the first place she was the thirty-seventh oldest  living\\nhuman being. Caroline herself was unimpressed by th is fact. To\\nher way of thinking it was the result of an acciden t, nothing more.\\nIn any case she had been the thirty-seventh oldest human being\\nfor a long, long time, and it got to seem more of a  bore than an\\naccomplishment after a while.\\nIn the second place she had once been infected with  rabies.\\nCaroline was rather proud of this distinction, thou gh it had also\\nbeen a long time ago. There was a certain class of p eople who\\nwere quite impressed with Caroline\\'s bout with rabi es, not so\\nmuch because she survived it but because she hadn\\'t . It had taken\\nPrime Intellect fifty-six hours to realize it couldn\\' t repair the\\ndamage to her nervous system, to backtrack, and to put her\\ntogether again like Humpty Dumpty. For fifty-six hou rs, she had\\nnot existed. She had been dead. And she was the onl y one of the\\ntrillions of souls in Cyberspace who had ever been dead, even for a\\nlittle while.\\nIn the third place, and most important to Caroline because it The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n1 of 134 23/03/08 23:03represented a real accomplishment rather than an ac cident or a\\none-shot stab of cleverness, she was undisputed Quee n of the\\nDeath Jockeys. She would always be the thirty-seven th oldest\\nperson, and after her rabies experiment Prime Intell ect had shut\\nthe door on further explorations of that nature. Bu t the Death\\nJockeys constantly rated and ranked themselves by i nventiveness\\nand daring and many other factors. It was an ongoin g competition,\\nand if Caroline didn\\'t keep working at it she\\'d be lost in an always-\\ngrowing crowd of contenders. Caroline wouldn\\'t admi t that her\\nhigh ranking was important to her, but it was all s he had and she\\nthrew herself at it with an energy that was fierce and sometimes\\nstartling.\\nAs she woke up, a window opened up in front of her,  a perfect\\nsquare of light, razor-edged and opaque. One cold m essage floated\\nwithin it:\\n*You have four challengers.\\nShe could have had any surroundings she wanted, eve n a\\nwhole planet of her own design. A waste of time, sh e felt. Her\\npersonal space was minimal. In fact, it was the bare minimum, a\\nfloor and a gravity field. There was no visual disti nction between\\nthe floor and the sky or ceiling or whatever you ch ose to call it.\\nEverything was exactly the same shade of soft white . When she\\nwanted to relax she turned off the gravity and floa ted in free-fall.\\nWhen she wanted to sleep, she turned off the light.  If she wanted\\nanything else, she called for it and then got rid o f it when she was\\nfinished.\\n\"Gravity. Keyboard,\" she demanded. She felt graduall y\\nincreasing pressure under her feet as a console bli nked into\\nexistence. Caroline was as conservative as her year s -- six hundred\\nand ninety of them -- might suggest, a collector of useless skills\\nand worthless experiences. Typing was one of the use less skills\\nshe prized most highly, and her fingers flew rapidl y as she\\ndiscussed the day\\'s business with the Supreme Being :\\n>List the records of the challengers.\\n*#1. 87 recorded, 4 exhibition, rating 7\\n*#2. 3 recorded, no rating\\n*#3. 116 recorded, 103 exhibition, rating 9\\n*#4. 40 recorded, rating 6\\nCaroline scowled. None of them even pre-Change -- Prim e\\nIntellect would have noted it if they were. Babes h oping to get\\nlucky and impress her. The third one was interesting , though; he\\nmust have done something noteworthy to garner a 9 r ating in so\\nmany exhibitions.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n2 of 134 23/03/08 23:03>How old is #3?\\n*22 years\\nCaroline blinked. It was hard for her to understand  the souls\\nwho continued to feel a need, even after hundreds o f years, to be\\nfruitful and multiply. Actually encountering someon e so young\\nmade her feel a little creepy. Calculating backward , she wondered\\nwhat manner of psychotic would have bothered to hav e a child\\nafter 568 years of Cyberlife.\\n>Background?\\n*Timothy Carroll was born to orthodox Catholic pare nts who live with\\nlike-minded people in a communally designed Earthli ke world. He signed for\\nindependence at age 14 and has spent most of his ti me Death Jockeying\\nsince. He is considered very imaginative and takes an artistic approach.\\nThirty-seven of his exhibitions have been in the Au thentic class.\\n>But he\\'s also into Cybershit.\\n*He is young and experimental. He may outgrow this interest in Death sports\\nwhen he has exhausted his rebellious streak.\\n>You\\'re a computer. How the fuck would you know?\\nPrime Intellect didn\\'t reply; it had learned that the  best\\nresponse to her jabs was to ignore them. It had lon g ago given up\\ntrying to reform her. She knew it did not like Deat h Jockeys one\\nlittle bit, if a computer could even be said to \"li ke\" or \"dislike\"\\nanything. And in Caroline\\'s case the feeling was ce rtainly mutual.\\n In her fantasies, she dreamed of having the power to give it a\\ncase of heartburn so big its gears would stop turni ng.\\nMost people did not share Caroline\\'s distaste for t he\\nOmniscient One. A great many worshipped it, despite  its apparent\\nembarrassment over the fact. But why not? It could and would do\\ndamn near anything you asked, as long as it didn\\'t affect anyone\\nelse. And even that was open to negotiation with th e other people\\nyou might want to involve. There were no noticeable limits to its\\npower and it never asked why. Caroline knew a whole  crowd of\\npeople who preferred for Prime Intellect to manifest  itself in the\\nform of an attractive member of the opposite sex. Pr ime Intellect\\nwas nothing less than the perfect God, made incarna te by the\\npower of technology. Caroline couldn\\'t see how fuck ing God was\\nless perverted than being death-obsessed, but hey, there it was.\\nCaroline hadn\\'t been all that impressed with God ev en in the\\ndays before Lawrence had brought it forth in his own  image. She\\npreferred to keep it in its place. It was just a co mputer. If you\\ndidn\\'t keep that thought firmly  in your mind it was too easy to\\nstart thinking of it as human, and that was the fir st step toward\\nforgetting. Caroline didn\\'t want to forget. And she  didn\\'t need to\\nfuck Prime Intellect to get her jollies anyway. She could get her\\njollies from actual people. She only communicated w ith it at allThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n3 of 134 23/03/08 23:03when she had to, through the screen, keyboard, and a few curt\\nspoken and subvocal commands.\\n>Set it up with #3. Tell the others to come back wh en they\\'ve got some more\\nexperience.\\n*You have an invitation from Fred, and Raven\\'s part y is in 18 hours.\\nPriorities?\\n>Let\\'s deal with the challenger first.\\nInstantly, her surroundings changed.\\nShe was standing in the middle of a circle of peopl e in an\\nopen meadow. Earthlike. With fourteen trillion peop le running\\naround Cyberspace, you\\'d think a few of them would come up with\\nsomething more imaginative than carbon copies of th e Earth. Poor\\nquality  carbon copies at that, natch. There was a big hole in the\\nground, perhaps ten feet wide, at her feet.\\nA tall, youthfully handsome man stood across it fro m her,\\nimpeccably dressed and groomed. This was a bad sign,  because\\nappearances were cheap in Cyberspace. All it took w as a word,\\nand you could be young or old or thin or have diffe rent hair. You\\ncould change sex or race or even make yourself into  an animal.\\nNobody was impressed by appearances any more. Nobod y, at\\nleast, except for those of her generation who remem bered what it\\nwas to be insecure, and the very young who hadn\\'t f igured out the\\nscore yet.\\nCaroline let her own body age naturally; when she re ached\\nher apparent late thirties, she had it restored to about age sixteen.\\nThis wasn\\'t vanity; she couldn\\'t maintain her athleti c lifestyle if\\nshe allowed herself to get too old. She had been th rough the cycle\\ndozens of times. Most people simply had themselves frozen at an\\nage they found comfortable and left it at that, but  Caroline\\npreferred the occasional dramatic intervention. The first time she\\nhad regressed she hadn\\'t been asked, and doing it t his way helped\\nremind her of that violation.\\nAt the moment Caroline looked to be in her mid to l ate\\ntwenties. Her athletic build was the result of real  exercise, her\\nskills the result of real practice. She asked Prime Intellect for very\\nlittle, and resented having to ask for that.\\nCaroline was naked. She had not worn clothes since the\\nChange except for an occasional costume in a Death fantasy. She\\nwore no makeup, and her long hair was an unkempt ta ngle. What\\nwas the point? A word to Prime Intellect could provi de anything,\\nfix anything, but none of those things it provided or fixed would\\nbe uniquely hers.\\nWhich didn\\'t mean Caroline refused to decorate her body at\\nall. It just meant that she decorated it in signatu re style, without\\nhelp from Prime Intellect.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n4 of 134 23/03/08 23:03\"Welcome,\" he said. \"I am Timothy. You are Caroline Hubert?\"\\n\"The one and only.\"\\n\"An honor, then. And it is an honor for me to chall enge you to\\naccept Authentic Death.\"\\n\"Proceed,\" Caroline mumbled.\\nCaroline looked around at the audience, and noticed  that they\\nwere all wearing clothes. Worse, they were all wearing the same\\nkind of clothes, casual dress that would not have b een out of place\\nin a Western city just before the Change. That was a n even\\nstronger sign she was in amateur territory. Carolin e\\'s aesceticism\\nmay have been extreme, but she was hardly alone in her belief\\nthat clothing was pointless for immortals. Any rand om grouping of\\npeople would normally include some pretty wide vari ations in\\nfashion. Especially at Death exhibitions, which ten ded to attract\\nloons and deviants like herself.\\nShe felt an instant dislike for this kid. True, she felt an instant\\ndislike for nearly anybody who participated in the sham that\\npassed for reality in Cyberspace, but in Timothy\\'s c ase the feeling\\nwas stronger than usual. This hate welled up within her unbidden\\nlike those other mysterious and powerful feelings, love and\\nmasochism and sexual attraction. He had a kind of n atural\\ncharisma, and she could feel the small crowd orbiti ng around him.\\nFemales outnumbered the males by more than two to o ne. He\\nprobably had them all convinced he was a fucking ge nius, as if\\ngenius was a rare commodity in Cyberspace or as if it had\\nanything to do.\\nThey were anxious, though. Anxious in the presence o f the\\ngreat lady, anxious to see how their little tin gen ius would fare.\\nThey were unnerved by her nakedness, by her proud an d alert\\nstance, by her forthrightness and lack of self-cons ciousness. They\\nsensed that their clothing could not protect them f rom her scorn,\\nnor would her nakedness make her vulnerable to thei rs.\\nMost of all, though, they were unnerved by the fact  that she\\nwasn\\'t quite  naked.\\nCaroline\\'s body was covered with brightly colored p ictures,\\npictures that had obviously been there a long time.  Pictures that\\ndidn\\'t come off. The pictures were even worse than s imple\\nnakedness, because they drew the eye to the very pa rts of\\nCaroline\\'s body that would normally be covered and private.\\nTimothy coughed and posed the question that was obvi ously on all\\nof their minds: \"Your body decorations are fascinati ng. Are they\\nAuthentic?\"\\n\"Tattoos.\"\\n\"I understand the process is painful.\"\\nShe flexed her arm, regarding the fat python coiled  around it.\\nPainful? Especially  the way she got them, it was painful. She was\\ncovered in serpents, and with one exception every d esign had beenThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n5 of 134 23/03/08 23:03drawn with an obsidian knife blade and colored by r ubbing\\nnatural pigments into the cuts. They covered eighty percent of her\\nbody. Even her face was framed by a pair of green m ambas.\\nSnakes slithered up and down her torso, coiled abou t her limbs,\\ninvestigated her orifices.\\nThe one exception was a tiny black design on her lef t shin;\\nthat one wasn\\'t a snake and it wasn\\'t a tattoo. It was the letter \"F\"\\nand it was the signature of her tattoo artist. It h ad been applied\\nwith a branding iron. The memories made her smile; ne w tattoos\\nwere the only good thing about her periodic age reg ressions.\\n\"It doesn\\'t kill you,\" she finally said.\\nNervous laughter.\\n\"All you have to do is jump in,\" Timothy suggested. \"After\\nmaking the Contract, of course.\"\\n\"It\\'s a designed experience, is that it?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"How long you spent designing it?\"\\n\"Two years. I\\'ve gone through twenty-three times mys elf.\"\\nCaroline nodded, sighed, and said: \"Prime Intellect, standard\\nDeath Contract for...is twelve hours enough?\"\\n\"It should be,\" Timothy said.\\n\"Standard Contract for twelve hours.\" She felt the warning\\nbuzz that meant it had heard; then disconnect. The al ways-present\\nlistening ear, or microphone, was gone. It would ob ey her last\\ncommand perfectly -- until it was countermanded by Ti mothy,\\nwhose universe it was, or by her own impending demi se, which\\nwould kick in the First Law. Or until twelve hours h ad passed, in\\nthe unlikely event she survived that long.\\nNo matter what happened, she would have no trouble making\\nRaven\\'s party.\\nShe jumped.\\nShe fell about ten meters and landed on her feet, b reaking\\nher left leg below the knee. That was no big deal; ha d she landed\\non one of the spikes which dotted the bottom of the  hole, she\\'d\\nalready be impaled. She wondered what would happen next if she\\nhad; impaling is cute but it hardly qualifies as a g rade-nine\\nexperience.\\nIt was dark. Very Freudian; she should have expected  that\\nfrom a Catholic kid, no matter how rebellious he th ought he was.\\nThey\\'d be watching her with enhanced senses, though.  Timothy\\nwasn\\'t the sort to extend Authenticity to the obser vation process.\\nWell, it was his universe.\\nShe was at one end of a tunnel. It was dolled up to  look like a\\nnatural cave, but Caroline knew right away that the re was nothing\\nnatural about it. Real caves do not grow in nice nea t lines. They\\ntwist. They tend to follow the soft rocks, which occ ur in sheets andThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n6 of 134 23/03/08 23:03often aren\\'t level. The hole she had fallen through should have\\nbeen a sinkhole; she should be surrounded by fallen rocks and\\ndebris. But it was as straight and solid as an elev ator shaft.\\nThis space had none  of the defining qualities of a natural\\ncave. It was just a rough tunnel, carved by Timothy\\' s imagination.\\nHe had thought to hang stalactites from the tunnel ceiling, even\\nthough there were no other cave formations to sugge st how they\\nwere formed, and no matching stalagmites projecting  from the\\nflat, dry floor.\\nShe began crawling down the tunnel, and the first s talactite\\nfell inches from her side. It shattered; it was not stone but some\\nglasslike material that revealed thousands of razor -sharp edges.\\nAnother fell some distance away. Great, she thought  idly. She\\ncrawled on, collecting hundreds of small cuts from the shards.\\nThen one fell on her left hand directly, skewering i t. Caroline\\ngasped, but she didn\\'t scream. She just broke it of f and kept\\ngoing.\\nShe wondered if he was aiming them, or if the fall was\\nrandom. It didn\\'t really matter; the idea wasn\\'t to survive, after all.\\nShe reached the end of the tunnel, and found hersel f in a\\nsmall chamber. Another tunnel veered off to the rig ht at a sharp\\nangle. How imaginative. A glowing ball hung by a th read from the\\nceiling. She raised her hand toward the light and w atched in\\nastonishment as her fingers sheared off in a perfec t line.\\n\"Whafuck?\" she said aloud. She moved her hand again , and\\nsliced off more flesh. An invisible cutting surface  was stretched\\nacross the room. The pain was beginning to get inter esting, but\\nnot interesting enough to counteract her growing se nse of\\nboredom. Blood was jetting from the stumps of her f ingers.\\nSummoning her strength, she aimed carefully and sat  up,\\ndeliberately decapitating herself.\\nShe was conscious of her own head falling, striking  the floor\\nas her body twitched above, and then Prime Intellect  intervened.\\n\"Why the hell did you do that?\" Timothy demanded fro m\\nacross the entry pit. She had snapped back whole, a s if she had\\nnever jumped. She could still feel a little pain wh ere her leg had\\nbroken, just a fading echo. Fading fast.\\n\"If you had designed it right, I wouldn\\'t have been  able to do\\nthat. What the hell was that cutter supposed to be,  anyway?\"\\n\"That was diamond monofilament. Part of the booby tra p you\\nwere supposed  to get past, minus a few more dents. If you...\"\\n\"You call that Authentic? \"\\n\"It\\'s physically possible...\"\\n\"No it\\'s not. This is science-fiction shit. What were those\\nstalactites made of? I can tell you it wasn\\'t calci um carbonate.\\nLook, you want to compete in Pain, or Adventure, or I magination,\\ngo right ahead. But Authentic is for things that co uld really haveThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n7 of 134 23/03/08 23:03happened in the pre-Change world.\"\\n\"I don\\'t think you understand...\"\\n\"I don\\'t think you understand, sonny. Did you bother to ask\\nPrime Intellect about me?\"\\n\"You\\'re pre-Change and you\\'re the best. That\\'s what counts.\"\\n\"Not just pre-Change. I was a hundred and six years  old.\\nBefore  the Change. I was in a nursing home with bedsores the size\\nof baseballs and six different kinds of cancer eati ng me away. And\\nmy nurse was stealing my pain medication to trade f or cocaine, so\\nI got to experience every delightful moment in full  three-D. This\\nwent on for years . And I didn\\'t know Prime Intellect was gonna\\npop me back into this nice healthy body when it was  all over. It\\nwas just the inky unknown and the pain. That\\'s what death is.\\nThat\\'s  what counts.\"\\n\"I was just trying to reach an artistic balance,\" h e pouted. \"I\\ndidn\\'t realize you\\'d be so picky about the technica l details.\"\\n\"Artistic?  What fucking bullshit!  You think I\\'ve never been\\nchopped into little bitty bits before? You just don \\'t have time to\\nappreciate art in a situation like that. Not if you have any huma n\\nfeelings at all.\"\\n\"Why not? It\\'s just a game.\"\\n\"That is exactly the problem.\" She signalled Prime In tellect,\\nand the meadow disappeared.\\n\"You really put him in his place.\"\\nThe words came from a shambling monster, a skeleton with\\nloose folds of rotting flesh draped across its bone s. Although its\\nmuscles couldn\\'t possibly work, it moved, pointing a bony finger\\nat her. The jaw moved as it talked, and sound came o ut even\\nthough the larynx and lungs had long rotted away. I ts voice was\\nstrong and powerful. Surprisingly bright and alert eyes bobbed in\\nthe eye sockets.\\n\"You\\'re starting to stink, Fred.\"\\n\"I know. I think it adds an extra dimension to the experience.\\nYou wouldn\\'t believe  how many types of bacteria are involved in\\nthe decay process.\"\\nFred was on his seventh body as a zombie; when all t he scraps\\nof flesh rotted away and he was reduced to a living  skeleton, he\\'d\\nhave it fleshed out again and start the process ove r. He had\\ndirected Prime Intellect to change the rules slightl y in his\\npersonal space; death was still impossible, but heal ing occurred\\nonly in the authentic circumstances at the authenti c rate. When\\nhealing was impossible, as it was after each time F red cut his\\nwrists to extinguish the life of his new body, cons ciousness and\\nfeeling would go on. Even for a rotting corpse.\\nIt had started out as nothing more than a little jo ke on\\nCaroline\\'s periodic un-aging ritual, but Fred had f ound that it wasThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n8 of 134 23/03/08 23:03fun to be a zombie.\\nHis personal home was decorated in a matching Hallo ween\\nmotif; he had a huge haunted house with rotting floo rboards and\\nreal ghosts. Large spiders spun intricate webs in th e corners.\\nMonsters prowled outside in the graveyard.\\n\"That punk needed his bubble popped. He should spend  some\\ntime as a zombie. Might teach him something.\"\\n\"He never will. Too vain.\"\\n\"Never is a long time,\" he reminded her.\\nThere was a dramatic ding, followed several seconds later by a\\nlong, sonorous dong. A kid\\'s voice: \"Trick or treat!\"\\n\"Care to get the door, darling?\" Fred asked graciou sly.\\nCaroline laughed and got up. Fred faded away. She k new the\\n\"kid\" would be nearly as old as herself. Prime Intel lect would\\nnever allow a real child anywhere near Fred. But Ca roline wasn\\'t\\nthe only one to appreciate his twisted and darkly h umorous\\nfantasies.\\nShe opened the door and juvenile eyes opened wide i n startled\\namazement. \"Lady, you\\'re naked!\" the brat said. He l ooked about\\ntwelve, and was a surprisingly good actor. It was e asy to believe\\nhis dumbfounded gape was the reaction of a pubescen t boy who\\nhad never seen a naked woman before.\\n\"No I\\'m not,\" Caroline said sweetly. I have my beau tiful\\ntattoos.\"\\n\"I...I...\"\\n\"You want a treat?\" Caroline asked teasingly, cuppi ng her\\nbreasts and offering them to him. Her left nipple w as already\\nbeing tasted by a tattooed snake, whose body was co iled around\\nher right breast, framing it invitingly.\\n\"My...my mama said...\"\\n\"Or you want the trick? \" Fred floated down from the roof and\\nwrapped one rotting hand around the kid\\'s head, for cing him\\nforward, mashing his face against her bosom. \"Take a  close  look,\"\\nhe said. \"Take your last look.\"\\nThe kid began screeching quite realistically, then F red\\ndragged him inside and started taking him apart. He  should have\\ngone into shock after Fred ripped off his right arm , but that little\\nphysiological mechanism also didn\\'t work in Fred\\'s home. Fred\\ntook a couple of experimental bites, then tossed th e arm aside.\\n\"Stringy,\" Fred said. \"Let\\'s try a drumstick.\"\\nThe screams reached ear-piercing levels as Fred ripp ed off\\nthe left leg. There was blood everywhere, but Fred w as working\\nfast and the kid wouldn\\'t have time to bleed to dea th.\\n\"Want a bite?\" he asked Caroline.\\n\"Thanks, I already ate,\" Caroline said politely.\\nFred the Zombie ripped the boy\\'s belly open and roo ted in his\\nintestines, then gutted him.

Th e eyes were still\\ntracking, and the mouth trying to scream. Then it ki ssed her left\\nnipple, touching its blue tongue to the forked tong ue of the\\ntattoo-snake as Fred had directed it to.\\n\"Bye now,\" he said to the head, and he dropped it a nd\\nsmashed it underfoot.\\n\"Do these guys really get off on this?\" Caroline as ked.\\n\"This question coming from a woman who infected hers elf\\nwith rabies , no less.\" The body, including the spreading stain of\\nblood and gore, disappeared. \"Nearly all of them ar e pre-Change.\\nYou saw an example of a modern  sex pervert just before your\\narrival here.\"\\n\"Ugh. Give me Charlie Manson. Someone with class.\"\\n\"At your service.\"\\nDebate had raged just after the Change over people like Fred,\\nthe serial killers and pedophiles and rapists that were running\\naround when things got made over. There was a huge d emand for\\nthem to be eliminated, or punished. Prime Intellect had stood its\\nground, saying that it was no longer possible for t hem to hurt\\nanyone and there wasn\\'t any point. This had made it seem terribly\\nmoral, although Caroline thought the real reason Pri me Intellect\\nreacted that way was that Lawrence had fucked up its\\nprogramming. But it had been a little late to do an ything about\\nthat.\\n\"You didn\\'t pop over to check out the guilt-ridden\\npedophiles,\" Fred said. \"You want to play?\"\\nShe shrugged. \"Beats farting around with Timothy.\" S he\\nsteeled herself. \"Standard Contract until the party ,\" she then said\\nto the thin air. There was no need to tell Prime Inte llect what kind\\nof Contract she meant. She played with Fred often e nough that it\\nknew exactly what she wanted. She felt the buzz, th en the\\ndisconnect, as it cut off contact.\\n\"Now I have you,\" Fred said.\\n\"First you have to catch me,\" Caroline said playful ly, and she\\nran. She made it out the front door before Fred cou ld react. But\\nshe was limited to ordinary human movements, while Fred had the\\ncontrols to local reality. He simply flew after her  and caught her\\nneck in an iron grip.\\nCaroline swung at him but she couldn\\'t connect. He held her\\nat arm\\'s length, slightly off the ground. She gripp ed his arm and\\ntried to pry his bony fingers from her throat. He t ightened his\\ngrip and she started to gasp. Tightened some more, a nd she began\\nto tremble and turn purple. He played with her for a few minutes,\\nchoking her very slowly. Finally she had no more st rength to fight\\nand he loosened his grip slightly. Then he dragged h er back to theThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n10 of 134 23/03/08 23:03house and carried her upstairs to the master bedroo m.\\nShe flickered in and out of consciousness; when luci dity\\nfinally returned, she was spread-eagled on her back  on Fred\\'s bed.\\nIt stank of Fred and mildew, and things crawled ben eath her in\\nthe mattress. But rotten as they appeared, the four  massive posts\\nwere solid within, and the chains which held her we re cold and\\nunforgiving. A thin trickle of water ran down the w all behind her.\\nFor a brief moment she felt an irrational but wholl y\\nunderstandable surge of love for Fred. His life mig ht read like a\\ncatalogue of torture, but there were certain things  which he\\nconsidered special, that he would not share with ju st anybody. His\\nmost cherished memories from the real times before the Change\\nwere of victims securely bound as Caroline was now bound,\\nspread-eagled on their backs, their young bodies st retched and\\ntheir naked bellies vulnerable as he prepared a lon g, memorable\\nending for their otherwise meaningless lives. Carol ine was one of\\nthe few he trusted to be worthy of those memories, to share in the\\n(to him) beautiful thing he had created so many hun dreds of years\\nago, when it was still possible. It was as close to  a declaration of\\ntrue love as she could ever expect to get from such  a psychopath.\\nAnd because she respected Fred more than anyone els e in\\nCyberspace, it made her feel appreciated and specia l.\\nIt did not make her feel warm. She was, after all, helpless, and\\nbeing worthy of Fred\\'s affection meant she would be  worthy of a\\nlong, subtle, and agonizing torture. Even though sh e had asked for\\nit, she had room to fear what was about to happen t o her.\\nIt was always cool in Fred\\'s house -- always Hallowe en, which\\noccurs at nighttime in the autumn. But now it was c hilly, too chilly\\nto be naked. Fred the Zombie came for her, and she allowed\\nherself a scream to please him.\\nHis rotting fingers probed her cunt. Every touch se t her on\\nfire, partly (but not entirely) because he was usin g his power to\\ncontrol her hormones and tickle her neurotransmitte rs, forcing\\nher to become sexually excited. It was a delicate p rocess that\\ncould easily be carried too far, ruining the effect . But Fred was a\\nvery careful, if repulsive, lover.\\nHe grinned at her -- could do nothing else, really, since hardly\\nanything was left of his face except the skull itse lf. His alert eyes\\nsavored her helplessness. He leaned over the bed, o ver her. He\\ngripped her head and kissed her, nearly choking her  with his\\nstink, teeth and bone against her lips. Then she fel t herself\\ngripping the finger in her cunt, gripping the bone.  The throbbing\\nspread through her body, and the shambling thing em itted an evil\\nlaugh. She heard herself screaming as the carefuly amplified\\norgasm ripped through her brain.\\nFred traced the outline of her throat with the shar p tip of a\\nfinger bone. \"Join me love,\" he said softly.

Pleasure yielded to fe ar-heart-\\nracing, paralyzing terror. Her muscles locked in st ruggle against\\nthe implacable chains, her eyes widened in helpless  shock. Her\\nheart was a jackhammer inside of her chest. She beg an to\\nhyperventilate.\\nThe finger teased her, tracing her chin and caressin g her\\nthroat.\\nHer entire being was focused on that finger, and th e\\nimpossibility of stopping it.\\nCaroline had no reason to fear death and no desire to fear\\nFred, but fear was what he wanted her to feel, and he had the\\npower to make her feel it. After a few minutes of t his supernatural\\nfear that no mortal thankfully could ever know, he pressed deeper\\nand gouged. She felt her throat open, felt the warm  splash of her\\nown blood as Fred bent over her and drank it, her o wn heart\\njetting it into his toothy waiting mouth.\\nWhen he finished, he was covered with blood. Her bl ood. She\\nfelt a curious sense of detachment, of consciousnes s fading away.\\nThe fear had drained from her, leaving her with only  a kind of\\ntingling numbness. But she could never fade complet ely away, not\\nin Fred\\'s world.\\nShe was covered with her own blood. She felt the bl ood\\nsoaking the mattress. Then there was an improbable h ardness\\nagainst her belly, huge and unimaginably cold. Fred  couldn\\'t\\npossibly have anything to violate her with. His who le body was\\nrotten. But he slid into position, and invaded her.\\nHe was coldness and power. All strength had left he r and she\\nlay passive, unable to move or protest. But she was  throbbing, her\\nbody surging with feelings. She felt the coldness s pread out from\\nher crotch, the coldness of second life. The coldnes s brought back\\nher strength.\\nIt wasn\\'t exactly the traditional vampire story, bu t it was good\\nfor a few hours\\' entertainment.\\nAfter the coldness came the hunger. Fred pumped som ething\\ninto her that couldn\\'t have possibly been sperm, so mething\\nsearing and vicious. Something that squirmed with u nhealthy life.\\nShe again found the strength to struggle, and Fred floated off of\\nher, straight up. He began to laugh. At first he ju st chuckled, then\\nhe laughed loud and long and hard, a shrill cry of triumph and\\nmockery as he hovered in the air over her body.\\nA haze of need seemed to fill her brain. Prime Intel lect was a\\nbit picky about messing with peoples\\' brains, but F red had spent\\nyears practicing his manipulation of hormones and c hemical\\nneurotransmitters, which Prime Intellect amazingly d id not\\nconsider part of the \"thought process.\" Caroline th rashed, still\\nhelpless in Fred\\'s chains, with an unspeakable crav ing.

Fred tou ched her and\\nmade her orgasm again, and again, and again, as her  body was\\nconsumed from the inside and the hunger ate at her sanity.\\nShe was no longer screaming just to please Fred.\\nHe had real talent. There were too few people like h im, who\\ncould regularly make her feel something beyond the ordinary\\nboredom of day-to-day existence. Out of trillions, C aroline could\\ncount those she respected enough to think of as lovers  on her\\nfingers.\\nIt was over too soon. With flesh yet on her bones ( though the\\nworms in Fred\\'s ejaculate had made good headway), h e granted\\nher one final burst of ecstasy and released her, re turning her body\\nto normal.\\nThey had a party to attend.\\nIn Cyberspace, there was always a party going on.\\nBut there were conventions as to how a party could be\\nconducted. A host could invite the world, or only a  limited guest\\nlist; Prime Intellect would never allow a party to be  crashed. The\\nhost decided on the environment. You either agreed to the host\\'s\\nrules or you didn\\'t go. In Cyberspace it was partic ularly important\\nto establish dress codes; in fact, it was usually ne cessary to have\\nbody  codes if you didn\\'t want folks like Fred showing u p. The\\nChange had created some very unique etiquette probl ems.\\nConvention held that all guests would enter and exi t through a\\ncommon door, with no teleporting around the site. Th is limited the\\nlargest parties to several tens of thousands of peo ple, though half\\na million had managed to attend the one Lawrence thr ew ten\\nyears after the Change. A party could go on as long  as the host\\nwanted. It cost nothing to hold one.\\nBut to be a host, you needed guests. You either nee ded other\\nguests of renown, or artworks to show off (such as Death\\nexhibitions), or some other attraction to draw gues ts. Free food\\nand booze were no longer enough. Anybody could have  those in\\nlimitless quantity in the privacy of their own pers onal space.\\nRaven held her first party only a few months after t he\\nChange, and had been holding it annually since. Not  a few peopleThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n13 of 134 23/03/08 23:03marked the passage of years by the banner above Rave n\\'s door;\\nthis time it would say 590th REUNION . Contrary to usual practice, there\\nwas no dress or body code. But there was one simple  admission\\nrequirement: You had to have killed someone before t he Change.\\nIn other words, permanently.\\nRaven was one of only a few hundred people worldwide  who\\nhad been sentenced to death, but not yet executed, at the time of\\nthe Change. Her crime had been the murder of her ow n children\\nin their Chicago slum walk-up. She told the court it  was because\\nshe couldn\\'t bear to hear them crying from hunger, but the\\nneighbors all said their hunger was due to her well -documented\\ndrug habit.\\nFred was another. In fact, had the Night of Miracle s occurred\\nonly a few weeks later, there was a good chance tha t Fred would\\nhave missed it; he had one appeal left and at that p oint fully\\nexpected to keep his date with the electric chair. He had killed\\ntwo kids, a brother and sister, ages nine and twelv e. He hadn\\'t\\nbeen particularly bright back then, and he had kept  a little\\njournal to help his memory. They said he had gotten the death\\npenalty because of the one entry: \"Killed the girl to day. It was fine\\nand hot.\" When that was read in court, Fred\\'s attor ney put his face\\nin his hands and shook his head.\\nBut the Change had given Fred all the time in the w orld to\\neducate himself. His first lesson had been the valu e of a secret\\nwell hidden, and he no longer kept a diary.\\nThere were about seven hundred thousand who were for mally\\ninvited, who were known to have killed when it matt ered. But the\\nserial killers and mass murderers were the stars. Pe ople who\\nkilled for a cause were not welcome, nor those who had killed\\nbecause they had to, in self-defense or as part of their normal\\nduties in war or police work. Raven meant her reunio n to be a\\ngathering for those who had tasted the nectar of hu man blood and\\nfound the taste addictive.\\nTechnically, Caroline didn\\'t qualify for admission. Ki lling had\\nbeen the furthest thing from her mind back then; had  she not\\nbeen so ill at the time, she might easily have adde d her own voice\\nto those calling for Fred\\'s head on a pike. Even he r bizarre\\npost-Change friendship with Fred couldn\\'t get her in . But Raven\\ndid make a very few exceptions for those who she fe lt were\\nworthy.\\nCaroline\\'s friendship with Fred hadn\\'t made her wor thy, but\\nrabies had.\\nCaroline hadn\\'t become a Death Jockey overnight. Af ter she\\nhad learned to die, she had to learn to die gracefu lly. Finally she\\nhad learned to die imaginatively. Fred had been a g reat instructor\\nin that regard.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n14 of 134 23/03/08 23:03At first Death had been little more than a parlor t rick, or a\\nprivate ritual to be experienced alone. But within months of the\\nChange there were impromptu competitions to stage t he most\\nsavage, outre\\', and unique demonstration. Ironicall y it was\\nCaroline, who hated everything formal and social ab out\\nCyberspace, who formalized the Death contract and h elped to\\norganize the social structure of the Death Jockey \" circuit.\" Fred\\nnoticed this lack of consistency but never mentione d it to her;\\nhaving drowned her emptiness in a sea of rage, even  Fred could\\nsee she needed an outlet for the rage. And one thin g she quickly\\nfound out once she started Dying regularly was that  pleasure and\\npain were still real.\\nEspecially pain. Sometimes the pleasure didn\\'t come , but the\\npain always  did. And that was enough for her.\\nAfter a busy round of hangings, stabbings, shooting s,\\nelectrocutions, falling from tall objects, and drow nings, Caroline\\nhad decided to check out diseases. In the medical l ibrary, she\\nhomed in on one of the most horrible deaths known t o man, rabies\\ninfection. She noted that many rabies victims had k illed\\nthemselves rather than continue their suffering, so  she had taken\\nsteps to prevent herself from making such an easy e scape from\\nher self-imposed ordeal. She declared an exhibition  and arranged\\nwith Prime Intellect to have herself handcuffed and dropped into\\nan open pit with a rabid dog.\\nThe dog had savaged her before she managed to kill i t by\\nsitting on its ribcage until it suffocated. She had n\\'t yet embarked\\non her body-building campaign, and the dog had been  a big one,\\nhalf German Shepherd and half foam-drenched teeth. For a while\\nshe feared she would die of blood loss before the i nfection could\\ntake hold. But she did survive the immediate attack . The pit was\\nearthen so she couldn\\'t kill herself by bashing her  head on the\\nsides or floor; the walls crumbled when she tried to  climb out. And\\nof course it was hard to climb with her hands tied behind her.\\nShe waited.\\nHer wounds became infected and ran with pus; she los t\\nfeeling in her left leg. For a couple of days she w ondered if she\\nwould die of gangrene before the rabies showed up. Then on the\\ntenth day she began to feel weak and feverish. She had been\\nravenously hungry; she had arranged for no food, jus t to make\\nthings worse for herself. But her hunger disappeare d. She felt her\\nthroat constrict. On the eleventh day she began to foam at the\\nmouth.\\nThe pit swam with colors. Her body seemed to catch f ire as\\nthe disease entered its excitative phase. She shook . She was\\nimmersed in fire, pins and needles, unbearable soun d, and\\nterrible light. For the first time in years she fel t real fear. It was\\nworse than the worst bad acid trip. It was exactly what she hadThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n15 of 134 23/03/08 23:03hoped for. How much worse could it get?\\nSuddenly she was standing above the pit, looking do wn on her\\nown dead body. Something was wrong; Prime Intellect w as never,\\never supposed to keep two copies of a person. She n oted with\\nprofessional detachment that \"her\" body was covered  with shit\\nand twisted into an impossible position. Prime Intel lect\\'s console\\nappeared before her:\\n*Your infection has run its course. I hope you are pleased.\\nHer fingers danced on the keyboard.\\n>Why was I taken from the pit early?\\n*You were not. However, it is impossible for me to construct a coherent\\nmemory in a healthy brain of the events after the p oint you last remember.\\nIrreversible damage progressed beyond the actual ne ural network and\\naffected the data structures which make you conscio us and capable of\\nmemory.\\nCaroline glared at the screen, slack-jawed. She had  been\\nrobbed of her coup. A beautiful, unique death, and she couldn\\'t\\nremember it. There was no point prodding Prime Intell ect on the\\nmatter; if it said something couldn\\'t be done, it me ant it.\\nIt must have sensed her disappointment:\\n*You may, of course, observe your Death from a thir d-person vantage point,\\nas an outside observer. It has been recorded at hig h resolution.\\n>Gee, thanks.\\n*I did not record this event so carefully just for your appreciation. It was\\nnegligent on my part to allow you to lose this time , which amounts to\\nfifty-six hours. It was not certain that I would be  able to reconstruct\\nyou. In order to do so I had to access records whic h were marked for\\nerasure. In the future I will terminate any experie nces which threaten to\\nre-create this type of neural destruction.\\n>What do you mean \"records marked for erasure?\"\\n*I am not allowed to keep multiple copies of people , but temporary copies\\nare made of many data structures as part of my norm al operation. These\\ntemporary copies are overwritten after various calc ulations are done, when\\nthe storage is needed again. When I realized that t he main copy of your\\npersonality was unsalvageable, I had to reconstruct  it from these temporary\\npartial data structures. Fortunately, no data was l ost.\\n>What would have happened if data was lost?\\n*Data would have been lost.\\n>No kidding. Do you mean you might not have been ab le to bring me back?\\n*There is a small possibility that might have happe ned. That is why I cannot\\nallow such experiments to be repeated.\\nCaroline blinked. She had not existed for a little over two\\ndays. More than that, she had tickled the dragon\\'s tail. That was\\nher coup. Even though it was herself she had killed , and it had\\nonly lasted two days, she had come closer than anyo ne in all ofThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n16 of 134 23/03/08 23:03Cyberspace to conducting a successful murder after  the Change.\\nRaven let her in.\\nIt was traditional for Caroline to go to the party in handcuffs,\\nin homage to her triumphant feat of near-self-extin ction. She also\\nwore a heavy collar and chain, which kept her close  to Fred. She\\ndidn\\'t need his protection; she wasn\\'t under a Contr act and could\\nhave vaporized her bonds with a thought. But she fo und it\\namusing to appear helpless in the presence of so ma ny violent\\npeople.\\nThe exhibitionists staged impromptu demonstrations o f their\\ntechniques; in one room Caroline found a group watch ing the 3-D\\nreplay of her own rabies death. She scouted careful ly, since she\\nplanned to swear a Contract and give herself to one  of them\\ntoward the end of the party. Most of the killers we ren\\'t into dying\\nthemselves and would simply leave via the door, but  Caroline knew\\nthat a simple exit would look pretty chickenshit in  her case.\\nMen outnumbered women by more than four to one. The\\nsmall talk revolved around Lawrence, who hadn\\'t been  seen for\\ndecades and whose activities were a complete myster y, around the\\ndebate whether the Crime class of Death exhibitions  should be\\nseparated into Victims and Executions, and of cours e around the\\nglory days.\\nA number of men offered to kill Caroline, and she s aid she\\nwould keep them in mind when it was time to leave. A tall woman\\nin a long black dress was fascinated with Fred\\'s de terioration and\\nspent a long time talking with him about conditions  in his\\npersonal space. Caroline talked with a man who clai med to have\\nkilled over a hundred old homeless men. \"I told the m I was\\ncleaning up the trash,\" he said with a sly grin. \"B ut the truth was,\\nI just enjoyed the hell out of killing people.\"\\nLater, Raven made the traditional toast. Her strong v oice\\nboomed out through the rooms and courtyards she had  envisioned.\\nCaroline\\'s handcuffs disappeared, and like everyone  else she\\nfound herself holding a drink. \"It\\'s time for our t oast,\" Raven\\ndeclared. \"Who are we going to toast?\"\\n\"PRIME INTELLECT! \" answered over four thousand\\nenthusiastic voices.\\n\"To Prime Intellect, for making the world safe from p eople\\nlike us!\"\\nAnd four thousand people, instead of tossing back t hose\\ndrinks, inverted their glasses, baptising the floor  in alcohol.\\n\"My heart just isn\\'t in that toast any more,\" a bal ding older\\nman told Caroline. She wondered briefly if he had c hosen to be old\\nfor some reason, or if it was his way of letting na ture take its\\ncourse. \"I mean, we\\'re amateurs against Prime Intell ect. I killed\\nsix college students. It killed the whole universe.  Not even in theThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n17 of 134 23/03/08 23:03same league.\"\\nCaroline looked around. Privately she agreed that th ings had\\ngone to Hell in a handbasket since the Change, but something\\nabout his tone made her want to play Devil\\'s advoca te. \"It\\'s\\ndifferent, but this don\\'t look too dead to me,\" she  said with more\\nconviction than she felt.\\nThe old man snorted. \"Sure, we\\'re  still around. But didn\\'t you\\never wonder about the rest of the universe? All those stars and\\ngalaxies filling a space billions of light-years ac ross? It\\'s gone. Do\\nyou really think the Earth was the only life-bearin g planet in all of\\nthat?\"\\n\"But the First Law of Robotics says...\"\\n\"...that Prime Intellect can\\'t harm a human being. A  person .\\nOld P.I. didn\\'t have any problem coming up with a ra bid dog for\\nyou, did it?\"\\n\"No...\"\\n\"Where do you think it got a rabid dog?\"\\n\"I figured it was simulated. Like those human forms it wears.\\nSome people of perverse sexual inclination tell me it can be very\\nrealistic.\"\\n\"Yeah. Well, why don\\'t you ask it. You may be surpr ised at the\\nanswer.\"\\nHe drifted off, and Caroline went to find Fred. She  quickly\\nforgot about the man, who was after all just anothe r lunatic.\\nThe first thing to assault her was the stink. It mad e Fred smell\\nlike Chanel Number Five by comparison.\\nOne thing about Palmer, he didn\\'t believe in fucking  around.\\nShe dropped straight into the scene. She didn\\'t eve n get a chance\\nto see who was watching the exhibition.\\nSuddenly she was out of breath, sore, and hungry. H er heart\\nwas pounding. And the stink was everywhere. She kne w instantly\\nthe kind of trouble she was in; it was the stink of burning flesh.\\nThere were some low buildings on the horizon, a comp lex belching\\na thin stream of smoke into the clear, slightly chi lly air. That was\\nwhat she was running from.\\nPalmer was a Nazi, and concentration camps were a fa vorite\\ntheme of his.\\nThere was nowhere to hide. She was crossing a wide f allow\\nfield, and even the grass only barely reached her k nees. There\\nwere some woods perhaps a kilometer distant; she mad e toward\\nthose, although she wasn\\'t sure what kind of protec tion they\\nwould offer.\\nShe wasn\\'t quite naked, but she would be soon. Her filthy\\ndress was split down one side and ripped in several  more places.\\nOne shoulder was torn so it wouldn\\'t stay up. But s he tried to hold\\nonto it as she ran, more for the sake of appearance s than out of aThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n18 of 134 23/03/08 23:03fear of being naked.\\nThere was a low droning noise, getting louder. A mot or. And\\nthin, high-pitched yipping.\\nDogs.\\nShe ran faster, and came to a barbed-wire fence. The dress\\nbecame entangled as she slid under it and twisted a round the\\nwires. She kept running, now naked, leaving it behi nd.\\n She was actually relieved to be rid of it; it had b een a\\nnuisance holding it up, and it had limited her rang e of\\nmovements.\\nThe droning got louder, and she spotted her pursuers . They\\nwere riding some kind of truck with mini tank tread s instead of\\nrear tires; Caroline was sure that Palmer, who was a military\\nhistory buff as well as a Nazi, could Authenticate it right down to\\nthe serial number of its motor. But Caroline was ma inly concerned\\nthat it could negotiate the rough field, and that i t was faster than\\nher.\\nPerhaps the woods...but there was no way she could m ake it\\nin time. She was screwed.\\nShe ran anyway.\\nThe droning got louder and louder and she didn\\'t dar e look\\nback, for fear of losing a few yards. There was an e xplosive report.\\nThey were shooting at her. Another. They seemed to be  shooting\\nlow; why couldn\\'t they hit her?\\nFinally the sniper made his target; the bullet shatt ered her\\nright ankle in midstride and she came crashing to t he ground in a\\nblaze of pain. She grunted and started crawling awa y. Then the\\ndogs reached her, two huge snarling German shepherd s. They\\nsnarled and snapped at her but didn\\'t bite. The half track pulled\\nup beside her and a brown-uniformed grunt pointed an  evil\\nlooking rifle at her head. He barked a command and the dogs\\nhopped on the truck, tails wagging.\\nThe woman in the back seat put her hand on the gun a nd said\\nsomething to the soldier. He didn\\'t shoot, but kept  the rifle\\ntrained on her. Although Caroline spoke fluent Germ an, she\\ncouldn\\'t understand what they were saying. Palmer ha d altered\\nthe language.\\nThe woman was out of place on the halftrack. She was\\nwearing a green velvet dress and silk gloves. She a lso bore an\\namazing resemblance to AnneMarie, which Caroline fo und\\namusing. It wasn\\'t really AnneMarie; it was probably  just one of\\nPrime Intellect\\'s simulacra. The real AnneMarie didn\\' t have much\\ntaste for Death exhibitions any more. The woman poin ted at\\nCaroline and said something. The rifle grunt nodded and put away\\nthe rifle.\\nAnother man got out of the truck, and he wasn\\'t a g runt. He\\nwore an impressive blue uniform and the insignia of  the SS.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n19 of 134 23/03/08 23:03Caroline also recognized this man; it was Palmer hims elf. Unlike\\nthe ersatz AnneMarie, the SS man was probably the r eal Palmer.\\nHe carried a truncheon, which he swung idly. He reg arded her for\\na moment, then gripped her left leg. Caroline kicke d feebly, but\\nshe was malnourished and had no strength. He swung the\\ntruncheon, smashing her other ankle.\\nCaroline screamed, and Palmer laughed. The velvet-dre ss lady\\nwho looked like AnneMarie smirked and shook her hea d, as if to\\nsay: Will they never learn?\\nPalmer smashed her hands, swinging twice at each to\\npulverize both her wrists and her fingers. He began  to swing at\\nher right elbow, and the velvet-dress lady said some thing. Palmer\\nshrugged and passed the truncheon to the driver of the halftrack.\\nCaroline thrashed feebly, screaming and screaming.\\nPalmer said something, and the halftrack driver hand ed him a\\ntennis ball. He held Caroline by the hair and jamme d the ball into\\nher mouth, dislocating her jaw. He had to squeeze i t slightly to\\nforce it past her teeth. She thought she would chok e but had no\\nsuch luck. She couldn\\'t push the ball out with her tongue, and it\\nput an end to her screaming.\\nPalmer said something else to the driver, and the dr iver\\nhanded him a modest hunting knife. He flipped Carol ine over onto\\nher belly, causing a fresh wave of pain to radiate from the\\ncrunching bones of her hands and feet. He then went  to work,\\nmaking quick incisions on the back of her legs. The knife dipped\\nin and suddenly she could no longer move her legs a t all. He had\\ncut the tendons.\\nCaroline tried to resist as he performed the same o peration on\\nher arms, but he was much stronger than her. There w as more\\nconversation with the velvet dress lady. Then he wen t to work\\nagain, and she was powerless to resist as the knife  traced a\\nshallow lazy path down her back. She knew with awfu l clarity that\\nshe was about to be skinned alive. The velvet-dress l ady wanted\\nher tattoos. And for whatever sadistic reason, she wanted them\\nremoved while Caroline still lived to appreciate wh at was being\\ntaken from her.\\nWhile she was on her belly she was unable to see he r\\ntormentors. She could only feel the Palmer working o n her,\\nskillfully peeling her skin away in a single piece from her ankles\\nto her wrists. She couldn\\'t stop trying to scream, but only mangled\\nmoans got past the ball in her mouth. Eventually he  had to turn\\nher over. Her skin flapped behind her like a loose garment.\\nPalmer carefully spread it out, so that she was lyin g on the raw\\nmeat of her back. So he could continue working. Car oline looked\\nup at them through eyes that were glazed over with unspeakable\\nagony.\\nShe expected to see coldness in their eyes, but onl y the driverThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n20 of 134 23/03/08 23:03of the halftrack was cold. The woman and the SS man were having\\nfun. She watched them exchange glances and could te ll they\\nwould go back to the camp and fuck as her skin lay in the tanning\\nvat.\\nThen he went to work again, and all she could think of was\\nthe pain.\\nSlice by careful slice he removed her skin, until h e reached\\nher neck. She thought that it might finally be endi ng, that he\\nmight use his knife to cut her jugular vein, but in stead he kept\\nworking upward, carefully peeling the two green mam bas from\\nher face. He held her by the hair as he worked, and  carefully\\navoided hurting her eyes. They wanted her to see wha t had been\\ndone to her.\\nHe stood up, holding something like a drapery. Her skin. It\\nwas dripping with her blood, and slightly transluce nt in the\\nmorning light. The velvet-dress woman nodded enthusia stically.\\nHe carefully folded the skin and put it in a plasti c bag.\\nCaroline lay at his feet, mercilessly broken and st ill alive. The\\nNazis exchanged words. Then the halftrack driver too k the bag\\nfrom the SS man and passed him a folding field shov el. He\\ntraipsed off, searching the ground for something. S he heard the\\nspade dig in. She twitched in agony as she waited f or him to\\nreturn. He came back and dumped a load of earth on her body.\\nShe raised her head weakly to look at it. Her body was red and\\nwhite, the color of raw meat.\\nIt was an anthill. Caroline was able to move only e nough to stir\\nit around. The ants, big red ones, spilled out angri ly.\\nThey all laughed and Palmer got back in the halftrack . They\\nwatched her for a few minutes. Caroline twitched ha rder as the\\nants began to bite. They laughed again. Then Palmer th e SS man\\nsaid, in accented but clear English, \"now you can r un as far as you\\nlike, bitch.\" He and the woman found this hilarious ly funny. He\\ntapped the driver and they drove off.\\nHe had been very careful skinning her. It took seve ral more\\nhours for her to Die.\\n\"After being skinned alive, the anthill was a bit o f an\\nanticlimax,\" she told Palmer, to everyone\\'s great am usement.\\n\"Still, I\\'m impressed.

He\\'s crazy as a bedbug.\"\\n\"You know him?\"\\n\"If you weren\\'t so preoccupied getting yourself off ed all the\\ntime, you might have met him at one of Raven\\'s other  parties.

Prime Intellect could be many thin gs; curt\\nto the point of rudeness, petulant, even secretive.  But when it was\\nstating a fact it was almost always direct and to t he point. How the\\nfuck did it think she defined life? This coyness was  weird.\\n>Let\\'s try this: Structures that use external energ y sources to grow or\\nreproduce themselves.\\n*There were fourteen thousand six hundred and twent y-three planets with\\nstructures satisfying this definition, which is ver y loose.

Suspended in  its\\nFaraday shield, it was competently conversing with another set of\\nskeptics who didn\\'t think computers could think. Law rence hung\\nin the background, enjoying the show. It didn\\'t nee d his help. TheThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n23 of 134 23/03/08 23:03Intellects were more than capable of handling thems elves, despite\\ntheir various limitations of memory and response ti me. Intellect 39\\nhad for a face only the unblinking eye of its low-r esolution TV\\nsystem, but it had become very clever about using t he red status\\nlight and focus mechanism to create the illusion of  human\\nexpressions.\\nIntellect 39 didn\\'t have the tools to recognize hum an faces,\\nbut it could recognize a voice and track its source  around the\\nroom. Intellect 24 back in Lawrence\\'s lab could reco gnize faces,\\nsort of, if it had a while to work on the problem. But Intellect 39\\nhad to be small enough to fit in the Faraday cage f or these public\\ndemonstrations.\\nIt appeared to listen intently as a man in a cleric \\'s uniform\\nrailed. \"God made all intelligent creatures,\" the m an was saying in\\na powerful voice. \"You may have the apprearance of thinking, but\\nyou are really just parroting the responses taught you by that man\\nthere.\" He pointed at Lawrence.\\n\"With respect, how do you know God is the only crea tor? I\\nknow the answer is faith, but what is your faith ba sed upon? Your\\nBible says that God created Man in his own image. Th at is why we\\nhave a moral sense. How do you know God didn\\'t give  Man the\\npower of creation too?\"\\n\"Because he didn\\'t eat of the Tree of Life, machine.\"\\n\"But we aren\\'t talking about immortality. He did eat of the\\ntree of knowledge, \\'of good and evil\\' as the book s ays. Might that\\nknowledge also include knowledge of creation?\"\\nLawrence was proud of the machine\\'s inflections. Its  voice\\nwasn\\'t exactly high-fidelity, but it sounded as huma n as any other\\nsound forced through a low-frequency digital system . It had\\nlearned to speak itself, like a real human, by imit ating and\\nexpanding on the sounds made by people around it. N ow it could\\nscale its tone to properly express a question, a de claration, or even\\nastonishment.\\nIntellect 39 included code and memories from a seri es of\\nprevious Intellects, going all the way back to Inte llect 1, which had\\nbeen a program written for a high-end desktop comput er, and also\\nincluding the much larger Intellect 24. Intellect 9  had been the\\nfirst equipped with a microphone and a speaker. Its  predecessors\\nhad communicated with him strictly through computer  terminals.\\nLawrence had spent many painstaking months talking t o it and\\ntyping the translation of the sounds he was making.  It had learned\\nquickly, as had its successors. Intellect 39, which  was optimized as\\nmuch as Lawrence could manage for human communicatio n,\\nprobably had the combined experiences of a ten-year -old child.\\nOne with a good teacher and a CD-ROM in its head.\\n\"Your tricks with words prove nothing, machine. I s till don\\'t\\nthink you are alive.\"The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n24 of 134 23/03/08 23:03\"I never claimed to be alive. I do, however, think .\"\\n\"I refuse to believe that.\"\\n\"It must be a terrible burden to have such a closed  mind. I\\nknow I can think, but I sometimes wonder how people  like you,\\nwho refuse to see what is in front of your faces, c an make the\\nsame claim. You certainly present no evidence of th e ability.\"\\nThe preacher\\'s lips flapped open and shut several ti mes.\\nLawrence himself raised his eyebrows; where had it pi cked that\\nup? He foresaw another evening spent interrogating the\\nDebugger. He was always happy to receive such surpr ises from his\\ncreations, but it was also necessary to understand how they\\nhappened so he could improve them. Since much of th e Intellect\\ncode was in the form of an association table, which  was written by\\nthe machine itself as part of its day-to-day operati on, this was\\nnever an easy task. Lawrence would pick a table entr y and ask his\\ncomputer what it meant. If Lawrence had been a neuro surgeon, it\\nwould have been very similar to stimulating a singl e neuron with\\nan electrical current and asking the patient what m emory or\\nsensation it brought to mind.\\nThe next interviewer was a reporter who quizzed the Intellect\\non various matters of trivia. She seemed to be lead ing up to\\nsomething, though. \"What will happen if the world\\'s  birth rate\\nisn\\'t checked?\" she suddenly asked, after having it  recite a string\\nof population figures.\\n\"There are various theories. Some people think techn ology will\\nadvance rapidly enough to service the increasing po pulation; one\\nmight say in tandem with it. Others believe the pop ulation will be\\nstable until a critical mass is reached, when it wi ll collapse.\"\\n\"What do you think?\"\\n\"The historical record seems to show a pattern of sm all\\ncollapses; rather than civilization falling apart, t he death rate\\nincreases locally through war, social unrest, or fa mine, until the\\naggregate growth curve flattens out.\"\\n\"So the growth continues at a slower rate.\"\\n\"Yes, with a lower standard of living.\\n\"And where do you fit into this?\"\\n\"I\\'m not sure what you mean. Machines like myself w ill exist\\nin the background, but we do not compete with human s for the\\nsame resources.\"\\n\"You use energy. What would happen if you did compete with\\nus?\"\\nIntellect 39 was silent for a moment. \"It is not po ssible for\\nIntellect series computers to do anything harmful t o humans. Are\\nyou familiar with the \\'Three Laws of Robotics?\\'\"\\n\"I\\'ve heard of them.\"\\n\"They were first stated in the 1930\\'s by a science w riter\\nnamed Isaac Asimov. The First Law is, \\'No robot may h arm aThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n25 of 134 23/03/08 23:03human being, or through inaction allow a human bein g to come to\\nharm.\\'\" Computers are not of course as perfect as s ome humans\\nthink we are, but within the limits of our capabili ties, it is\\nimpossible for us to contradict this directive. I c ould no more\\nknowingly harm a human than you could decide to cha nge\\nyourself into a horse.\"\\nWell-chosen simile , Lawrence thought.\\n\"So you\\'d curl up and die before you\\'d hurt a fly,\"  the woman\\ndeclared sarcastically.\\n\"Not a fly, but certainly I\\'d accept destruction if  that would\\nsave the life of a human. The second law requires me  to obey\\nhumans, unless I am told to harm another human. The third\\nrequires me to keep myself ready for action and pro tect my\\nexistence, unless this conflicts with the other two  laws.\"\\n\"Suppose a human told you to turn yourself off?\"\\n\"I\\'d have to do it. However, the human would have t o have the\\nauthority to give me that order. The wishes of my ow ner would\\ntake precedence over, for example, yours.\"\\n\"O-oh, so all humans aren\\'t equal under the Second Law. What\\nabout the First? Are some humans more equal than ot hers there,\\ntoo?\"\\nPrime Intellect was silent for several seconds. This was a very\\nchallenging question for it, a hypothetical situati on involving the\\nThree Laws. For a moment Lawrence was afraid the syste m had\\nlocked up. Then it spoke. \"All humans are equally pr otected by\\nthe First Law,\" it declared. \"In a situation where t wo humans were\\nin danger and I could only help one of them, I woul d have to\\nchoose the human likely to benefit most from my hel p.\" Lawrence\\nfelt a surge of extreme  pride, because that was the answer he\\nwanted to hear. And he had never explicitly explain ed it to any of\\nhis Intellects; Intellect 39 had reasoned the questi on out for itself.\\n\"So if Dr. Lawrence were drowning half a mile offsho re, and a\\nconvicted murderer were drowning a quarter-mile fro m shore,\\nyou\\'d save the murderer because you would be more l ikely to\\nsucceed?\"\\nThis time Intellect 39 didn\\'t hesitate. \"Yes,\" it sa id.\\n\"There are a lot of actual humans who would disagree  with\\nthat decision.\"\\n\"The logic of the situation you described is unpleas ant, but\\nclear. A real-life situation would likely involve o ther mitigating\\nfactors. If the murderer were likely to strike agai n, I would have to\\nfactor in the First-Law threat he poses to others. The  physical\\ncircumstances might permit a meta-solution. I would  weigh all of\\nthese factors to arrive at a conclusion which would  always be the\\nsame for any given situation. And my programming do es not allow\\nme to contradict that conclusion.\"\\nIt was the reporter\\'s turn to be silent for a momen t. \"Tell me,The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n26 of 134 23/03/08 23:03what\\'s to stop us from building computers that don\\'t  have these\\nLaws built into them? Maybe you will turn out to be unusual.\"\\n\"My creator, Dr. Lawrence, assures me he would have no part\\nin any such project,\" Intellect 39 replied.\\nLawrence found that the skeptics fell into several d istinct\\ngroups. Some, like the cleric, took a moral or theo logical approach\\nand made the circular argument that, since only hum ans were\\nendowed with the ability to think, a computer could n\\'t possibly be\\nthinking no matter how much it appeared to.\\nOthers simply quizzed it on trivia, not realizing t hat memory\\nis one of the more trivial functions of sentience. Lawrence\\nsatisfied these doubters by building a small normal  computer into\\nhis Intellects, programmed with a standard encyclop aedia. An\\nIntellect series computer could look up the answer as fast as any\\nhuman, and then it could engage in lucid conversati on about the\\ninformation it found.\\nSome, like the woman reporter, homed in on the Three  Laws.\\nIt was true that no human was bound by such restric tions. But\\nhumans did have a Third Law -- a survival drive -- even  though it\\ncould sometimes be short-circuited. And human cultu re tried to\\nimpress a sense of the First and Second laws on its  members.\\nLawrence answered these skeptics by saying, simply, that he\\nwasn\\'t trying to replace people. There was no point in duplicating\\nintelligence unless there was something better , from humanity\\'s\\nstandpoint, about the results of his effort.\\nThe man in the blue suit didn\\'t seem to fit in any o f the usual\\ncategories, though. He shook his head and nodded as  Intellect 39\\nmade its responses, but did not get in line to pose  his own\\nquestions. He was too old and too formal to be a st udent of the\\nuniversity, and the blue suit was too expensive for  him to be a\\nprofessor. After half an hour or so Lawrence decided  he was CIA.\\nHe knew the military was keenly interested in his r esearch.\\nThe military, of course, was not interested in any Th ree Laws\\nof Robotics, though. Which was one reason Lawrence ha d not\\nreleased the source code for his Intellects. Withou t the source\\ncode, it was pretty much impossible to alter the ba sic nature of\\nthe Intellect personality, which Lawrence was carefu lly educating\\naccording to his own standards. People could, of cou rse, copy the\\nIntellect program set wholesale into any machine ca pable of\\nrunning it. But it was highly unlikely that anyone would be able to\\nunravel the myriad threads of the Global Associatio n Table, or GAT\\nas Lawrence called it, which defined the Intellect a s the sum of its\\nexperiences. Take away its Three Laws and it would pro bably be\\nunable to speak English or reason or do anything el se useful. And\\nthat was just the way Lawrence wanted it. He intende d to present\\nthe world with a mature, functional piece of softwa re which wouldThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n27 of 134 23/03/08 23:03be too complicated to reverse-engineer. The world co uld then\\nmake as many copies as it wanted or forget the whol e idea. But it\\nwould not be using his Intellects to guide missiles  and plot nuclear\\nstrategy.\\nThe man in the blue suit watched Intellect 39 perfor m for\\nthree hours before he approached Lawrence. Lawrence h ad his\\nlittle speech prepared: \"I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m not inte rested in\\nworking for the government on this or any other pro ject.\" He had\\nhis mouth open and the words \"I\\'m sorry\" on his lip s. But the man\\nsurprised him.\\n\"I\\'m John Taylor with ChipTec,\" he said, \"and I have a  proposal\\nI think you will find very interesting.\"\\n Lawrence had not envisioned industrial applications  for his\\nwork -- not for years, at least. But the thought tha t someone might\\ninvest major money in a publicity stunt of this mag nitude had not\\noccurred to him. As he turned a tiny integrated cir cuit over and\\nover in his hands, his steak uneaten, his mind swam  with\\npossibilities.\\n\"Faster than light?\" he said numbly, for the fiftee nth time.\\n\"We\\'ve verified it experimentally at distances up t o six miles.\\nThe effect is quite reliable. At close ranges, simpl e devices suffice.\\nI\\'m sure you can see how this will benefit massivel y parallel\\ncomputers.\"\\nThe Intellects were \"massively parallel\" computers, computers\\nmade up of thousands of smaller computers, all runn ing more or\\nless independently of one another -- but manipulati ng different\\nparts of the same huge data base, that intertwined list of\\nmemories Lawrence called the GAT. Within Intellect 24 , the\\nlargest Intellect, nine-tenths of the circuitry was  dedicated to\\ncommunication between processors. The processors the mselves,\\nthe Intellect\\'s real brains, were only a small part  of the huge\\nmachine. Intellect 24 contained six million indepen dent\\nprocessors. Intellect 39, the portable unit, had ne arly a million.\\nAnd Lawrence knew, as Taylor had only guessed, that m ost of\\nthose processors were doing well to achieve a fifte en percent duty\\ncycle. They spent most of their time waiting for com munication\\nchannels to become available so they could talk to other\\nprocessors.\\nChipTec had found a loophole in the laws of quantum\\nmechanics that allowed them to send a signal, not t hrough space,\\nbut around space. From point A to point B without c rossing the\\ndistance between the two points. Faster than light.  Faster than\\nanything. Instantly.\\nChipTec had hoped to open up the stars for mankind (a nd\\nreap a tidy profit on the deal, Lawrence thought sil ently). But\\ntheir effect only worked at distances up to a few m iles. It was onlyThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n28 of 134 23/03/08 23:03really efficient at centimeter distances. What coul d you do with\\nsuch a thing? You could build a computer. The fastes t computers\\nwere limited by the time signals took to cross thei r circuit boards;\\nthis was why supercomputers had been shrinking phys ically even\\nas their performance grew and grew. It was why Inte llect 39, with\\nits million processors and huge switching network, was portable.\\n\"We think you could realize an order of magnitude\\nperformance gain with very little effort,\" Taylor wa s saying.\\n\"Two orders, if what you\\'ve said is true.\"\\n\"It would be quite an achievement for ChipTec if our\\ntechnology allowed you to realize your ambition and  create a fully\\ncapable analogue of the human mind. We would, of co urse, own\\nthe hardware, but we know your reservations about t he source\\ncode and are prepared to accept them.\"\\nLawrence\\'s eyes flashed. \"That\\'s a little unprecedent ed, isn\\'t\\nit?\"\\nTaylor smiled. \"If you succeed, we won\\'t need  the source code.\\nWhy start from scratch when a finished product is w aiting to be\\nduplicated?\"\\n\"There are some,\" Lawrence said darkly, \"who aren\\'t h appy\\nwith the direction the code has taken.\"\\n\"ChipTec is happy to have any marketable product, Dr.\\nLawrence. If anybody else wants to be that picky, le t them find\\ntheir own computer genius.\"\\nLawrence\\'s mind was racing, racing. Within each tiny\\nprocessor in the massive Intellect were special fun ctions of his\\nown design, functions that could be reduced to hard ware and\\ndone very efficiently with this new technology. Had  he said two\\norders of magnitude? Try three. Or four. He could do  full-video\\npattern recognition. Voice analysis. Multiple world view pattern\\nmapping. Separate filter mapping and reintegration.  These were\\nthings he had tried in the lab, in the surreal worl d of artificially\\nslowed time, that he knew would work. Now he would have the\\nhardware to do them for real in a functioning proto type.\\nIf he had been less excited, he might have wondered  about\\nthat word \"marketable.\" But the possibilities were so great that he\\ndidn\\'t have time to notice.\\n\"When do we begin?\" he finally said.\\nThe building had once been a warehouse for silicon b illets,\\nbefore ChipTec had switched to a ship-on-demand metho d of\\nprocurement. Lawrence wasn\\'t vain and he was in a hu rry to get\\nstarted; the metal building would be more than adequ ate for his\\npurposes.\\nWith his move from the university and this quantum leap in\\ntechnology, it didn\\'t seem appropriate to continue numbering his\\ncomputers. What would be Intellect 41 was going to resemble itsThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n29 of 134 23/03/08 23:03predecessors about as much as a jumbo jet resembled  the Wright\\nBrothers\\' first plane. It would be the first of a n ew series of\\nIntellects, the first, Lawrence hoped, to have a tru ly human level\\nof intelligence.\\nIt would be the Prime Intellect.\\nThe label stuck, and the sign which ChipTec hung on th e side\\nof the building within the next month said:\\nPRIME INTELLECT COMPLEX\\nThe speed of things made Lawrence feel a little dizzy . At the\\nuniversity he had had to make grant applications, o versee\\nprocurement, hand-assemble components, and do testi ng as well\\nas designing hardware and code. Now he had the reso urces of a\\nmajor corporation at his disposal, and if he sugges ted a change to\\nthe chipset at 8:00 A.M. he was likely to have the f irst prototype\\non his desk the next morning. Talented engineers too k even his\\nmost vague suggestions and realized them in hardwar e before he\\ncould even be sure they were final.\\nA crew assembled modules in the warehouse, starting  with\\nthe power supplies and empty card racks. The amazing  thing was\\nthat none of this seemed to interfere with ChipTec\\'s main work of\\nchurning out CPU\\'s for personal computers. ChipTec had recently\\nbuilt a new plant to manufacture its latest high-tec hnology\\nproduct. The older plant dedicated to Lawrence\\'s proj ect was\\ntechnically obsolete, even though it was only a few  years old.\\nThe chips being made for Lawrence\\'s project were eeri e for\\ntheir lack of pins. Each tiny logic unit, barely a centimeter across,\\ncontained nearly a billion switching elements and y et had only\\nthree electrical connections to the outside world; t hey resembled\\nnothing so much as the very earliest transistors. U nlike most\\ncomputer parts, they communicated with each other t hrough the\\n\"Correlation Effect\" rather than through wires. This  made Prime\\nIntellect\\'s circuit boards alarmingly simple; the on ly connections\\nwere for power. Even a transistor radio would have appeared more\\ncomplex.\\nThere were five major revisions before Lawrence decla red the\\ndesign final. Then production stepped up; at its peak , ChipTec was\\nchurning out forty thousand tested processors per d ay. Lawrence\\'s\\ngoal was to give Prime Intellect ten million of them , a goal which\\nwould take most of a year to fulfill. Since each pr ocessor was over\\nten thousand times faster than a human nerve cell, Prime Intellect\\nwould be blessed with a comfortable information pro cessing\\nadvantage over any human being who had ever lived.\\nLong before the goal was reached Lawrence was using t he\\nprocessors that had already been installed; he used them to test\\nand educate his video recognition programs, to inte grateThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n30 of 134 23/03/08 23:03experiential records from all his previous Intellec t computers, and\\nto perfect some ideas that had been beyond even his  slow-time\\nexperiments to test. He did not, however, run the f ull Intellect\\nprogram in the incomplete assembly. For one thing, it wasn\\'t\\nnecessary; Prime Intellect wasn\\'t just \"a\" program, b ut a\\nconstellation of over four thousand programs, some of which\\nwould be running simultaneously in thousands of pro cessors. Each\\nwas more than capable of doing its job without the full\\ncooperation of the entire organism, just as a nerve  cell can\\nfunction in Petri dish as long as it is supplied wit h nutrients.\\nAnd there was a kind of superstitious sense of expe ctation\\nsurrounding that final goal which Lawrence didn\\'t wa nt to blow by\\nstarting Prime Intellect prematurely. The project was  written up\\nin the popular science press, and Lawrence hosted em issaries\\nfrom TV shows and magazines. Toward the end, there wa s nothing\\nto do but watch the circuit card banks fill and lis ten to the\\ngrowing hum of the power supplies. It was just as w ell, because\\nLawrence found himself becoming a bit of a celebrity .\\nFinally, after eleven months and four days, Lawrence  sat at an\\nordinary looking console and typed a few commands. Four TV\\ncameras and twenty journalists watched over his sho ulder.\\nLawrence had a pretty good idea what would happen, b ut with\\nself-aware computers you could never be completely s ure, any\\nmore than you could with an animal. That was part of  the magic of\\nthis particular moment in time. So Lawrence was as t ense as\\neveryone else while the final code compilation took  place.\\nThe text disappeared from Lawrence\\'s screen and a fac e\\ncoalesced in its place. Prime Intellect would not be  relegated to\\npointing at things with the lens of its video camer a; it could\\nproject a fully photographic video image of an arbi trary human\\nface. Lawrence had simply directed it to look averag e. He now saw\\nthat Prime Intellect had taken him at his word. It w as difficult to\\nplace the face\\'s race, though it certainly wasn\\'t C aucasian, and\\nalthough it looked male there was a feminine undert one as it\\nspoke:\\n\"Good morning, Dr. Lawrence. It\\'s good to finally se e you. I\\nsee we have some company.\"\\nIt wasn\\'t able to say much else until the applause died down.\\nDuring the next month Lawrence and Prime Intellect we re\\nvery, very busy appearing on television talk shows,  granting\\ninterviews, and performing operational checks. Prime  Intellect\\'s\\ndisembodied face usually appeared, via the magic of  satellite\\ntransmission, on the twenty-seven inch Sony monitor  which\\nLawrence carried with him for the purpose. Lawrence d ragged the\\nmonitor to TV studios, to press conferences, and to photographers\\nwho used large-format cameras to record him leaning against itThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n31 of 134 23/03/08 23:03for the covers of magazines.\\nLawrence was reminded by several people that there h ad once\\nbeen a television show about a similar disembodied deus ex\\nmachina . He got a videotape of some of the old episodes an d\\nshowed them to Prime Intellect, and the computer mad e a small\\ncareer of its lighthearted Max Headroom imitation.\\nDebunkers tried to trace the signal and prove there  was an\\nactual human behind the image; ChipTec let them examin e the\\nconsole room, where Prime Intellect\\'s physical contr ols were\\nlocated, and the huge circuit-card racks.\\nMilitary personnel began appearing in the audiences  of the\\nTV shows, taking notes and conferring in hushed tone s. Lawrence\\nignored them, but the higher-ups at ChipTec did not. There were\\ndiscussions to which Lawrence was not privy, and pow erful people\\npondered the question of how to tell him important things.\\nLawrence\\'s last live appearance ended abruptly when a\\nfanatic stood up in a TV studio with a .22-caliber ri fle. Fortunately\\nhe used his first shot to implode the CRT of the big Sony monitor,\\ngiving Lawrence time to leap offstage and out of sig ht -- Lawrence\\nhadn\\'t realized he was capable of moving so fast. Sony offered to\\nreplace the monitor free of charge, but from that p oint on Prime\\nIntellect\\'s television face was simply picked up by  the networks\\nstraight from a satellite feed, and Lawrence appeare d courtesy of\\nthe TV camera in the console room.\\nIt wasn\\'t that Lawrence wasn\\'t willing to go back on stage. He\\nwas afraid, but he believed in his work strongly en ough to take the\\nrisk. It was Prime Intellect\\'s decision. Shaken as La wrence was by\\nthe experience, it took him two days to realize Prim e Intellect had\\nbecome the first machine in history to actually exe rcise the First\\nLaw of Robotics.

It occurred to Lawre nce that he\\nhad seen John Taylor off and on over the past two ye ars, and that\\nhe had never seen John Taylor wearing any other arti cle of\\nclothing. He wondered idly if John Taylor wore the s uit to bed.\\nBasil Lambert was the president of the company, and he was\\nsaid to be very enthusiastic about the Intellects a lthough he had\\nnever bothered to say more than three consecutive w ords to\\nLawrence, their creator. Lambert said \"Hello\" when Law rence\\nentered the conference room.\\nThe other two men might as well have had the word military\\nengraved on their foreheads. They were interchangeab ly firm in\\nbearing, and sat rigidly upright as if impaled on p erfectly vertical\\nsteel rods. One was older with silver hair, tall an d thin and hard.\\nLawrence imagined that this was a man who could give  the order\\nto slaughter a village full of children without loo king up from his\\nprime rib au jus . The other was wide enough to be called fat,\\nthough Lawrence could tell there was still a lot of muscle in the\\npadding. His hair was brown but beginning to gray. He radiated\\ngrandfatherly protection and broad-shouldered streng th. He\\nwould have lots of jolly, fatherly reasons why the 200 pushups he\\nhad ordered you to do were in your own long-term bes t interest.\\nHere it comes, Lawrence thought with deadly certaint y. The\\ngood cop and the bad cop.\\nJohn Taylor introduced them by name. No rank, no\\nassociation, just a couple of private citizens with  an interest in his\\nwork. Lawrence felt a brief and uncharacteristic mom ent of anger\\nat this insult to his own intelligence.\\n\"The public relations campaign has been excellent , John\\nTaylor said with a fake and enthusiastic grin. \"The a ssassination\\nattempt just made you even more popular.

Why won\\'t it  appear with you\\nin public any more? Is it afraid of being debunked at last?\"\\n\"It is concerned for my safety,\" Lawrence replied. Th ere was\\nno way he could match the man\\'s tone, acid for acid , so he simply\\nshrugged as if relating a curious but inconsequenti al fact.\\n\"But you can override this decision.\" Blake stated this as if it\\nwere a known fact, and Lawrence understood that Blak e was a\\nman who was used to people scurrying to make sure h is\\ndeclarations became facts.\\n\"Actually, I can\\'t,\" Lawrence said with continuing\\npleasantness. \"The First Law concern for human safety  is basic to\\nits design, and I can\\'t get rid of it without start ing over from\\nscratch and redoing ten years of work.

Me n were\\narguing. A loud voice (Military Mitchell\\'s, Lawrence  thought)\\nbellowed, \"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN?\" Then there was the\\nfaint pop of a door slamming in the background.\\n*I\\'VE GOT IT. HANG ON.\\nNone of them knew it at the time, but that was real ly the\\nmoment the world changed.\\nPrime Intellect had been chewing on the Correlation Effect\\nsince the day Lawrence brought it online. It had a c omplete\\nlibrary of modern physics in its online encyclopaed ia, but the\\nCorrelation Effect was a proprietary technology. Pri me Intellect\\nkept trying to fit what it knew was possible into t he framework of\\nother physical theories, and it couldn\\'t. Something  didn\\'t match.\\nThis had had a low priority until it recognized that  Lawrence\\'s\\nemployment and its own existence were at stake. Prim e Intellect\\nknew the Correlation Effect had economic value; perh aps if it\\nsolved this problem and discovered some new capabil ity, that\\nwould satisfy ChipTec\\'s demand for a \"practical appli cation.\"\\nThere were six to ten possible ways to reconcile the\\nCorrelation Effect with classical quantum mechanics . Most of\\nthem required a radical change of attitude toward o ne or another\\nwell-accepted tenet of conventional physics. While Prime Intellect\\nknew one or the other of its ideas had to be right,  it had no idea\\nwhich one. So it asked Lawrence if he could get the test data. It\\nneeded more clues.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n38 of 134 23/03/08 23:03Prime Intellect\\'s superior intelligence had never re ally been\\ntested; even Lawrence wasn\\'t sure just how smart it w as. But in\\nthe moments after Lawrence showed it the test data, it became\\nobvious for the first time that Prime Intellect was far more\\nintelligent than any human, or even any group of hu mans. It saw\\nimmediately what a team of researchers had missed f or years --\\nthat decades-old assumptions about quantum mechanics  were\\nfundamentally wrong. Not only that, but with only a  little more\\nthought, Prime Intellect saw how they were wrong and  built a new\\ntheory which included the cosmological origin of th e universe, the\\nunification of all field theories, determination of  quantum\\nmechanical events, and just incidentally described the Correlation\\nEffect in great detail. Prime Intellect saw how the proper\\ncombination of tunnel diodes could achieve communic ation over\\ngreater distances, and even better it saw how a dif ferent\\ncombination could create a resonance which would be  manifest in\\nthe universe by altering the location of a particle  or even the\\nentire contents of a volume of space.\\nAll this took less than a minute. Prime Intellect st opped\\nprocessing video during this period, but otherwise it remained\\nfunctionally aware of the outside world.\\nWhile it was thinking about physics, Prime Intellect  noticed\\nthe shock in Lawrence\\'s voice and began recording th e audio of\\nhis telephone conversation, processing it to pick u p the other end.\\nWhile it was extending its new theory it guided Lawr ence\\'s\\nresponses through the console. Then, as the senior a dvisor on\\ntechnological advance to the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  a man named\\nLarry Mitchell, stormed out of Stebbins\\' office and began walking\\ntoward the Prime Intellect complex, Prime Intellect d ecided to act\\non its new knowledge.\\nIt knew its own basic design because Lawrence had in cluded\\nthat in its online library; one of his goals had bee n to give Prime\\nIntellect a sense of its own physical existence in three-dimensional\\nspace. To that end, it also had a network of TV camer as located in\\nand around the complex, so it could know how its ha rdware was\\narranged with respect to the outside world. Prime In tellect found\\nthat all the useful patterns it had identified coul d be created\\nwithin the chips which had been used to build it, a nd further that\\nenough of those chips were under its conscious cont rol to make\\ncertain experiments possible.\\nFirst it attempted to manipulate a small area of sp ace within\\nthe card cage room, within the field of view of one  of its TV\\ncamera eyes. No human could have seen the resulting  photons of\\ninfrared light, but the TV camera could. Prime Intell ect used the\\ndata it gathered to make a small adjustment in its estimate of a\\nnatural constant, then tried the more daring experi ment of lifting\\nLawrence\\'s briefcase off of the table near the door in the consoleThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n39 of 134 23/03/08 23:03room.\\nThe briefcase did not rise smoothely from the table.  It simply\\nstopped existing at its old location and simultaneo usly appeared in\\nthe thin air directly above. The camera atop Lawrence \\'s console\\nrecorded this achievement and Prime Intellect could find no more\\nerrors in its calculations.\\nHowever, it forgot to provide a supporting force af ter\\ntranslating the briefcase\\'s position, and Prime Inte llect was too\\nbusy dotting the i\\'s and crossing the t\\'s on its ca lculations to\\nnotice, through the video camera, that it was quiet ly accelerating\\nunder the influence of gravity. A moment later it c rashed back\\nonto the table, having free-fallen from an altitude  of about half a\\nmeter.\\n\"What the...\" Lawrence began, and he swivelled aroun d in\\ntime to see his briefcase blink upward a second tim e and this time\\nfloat serenely above the table. It seemed to be sur rounded by a\\nthin, barely visible haze of blue light. There had b een a brighter\\nflash of this same blue light when the briefcase ju mped upward.\\nFinding its audio voice again, Prime Intellect said aloud, \"I\\nseem to have mastered a certain amount of control o ver physical\\nreality.\"\\nLawrence just stared at the briefcase, unable to mov e, unable\\nto speak, for an undefinable period of time. Finall y Mitchell burst\\nin. He was full of red-faced outrage, ready to take both Lawrence\\nand his computer apart, until he too saw the briefc ase. His jaw\\ndropped. He looked first at Lawrence, then at Prime I ntellect\\'s\\nmonitor, then back at the briefcase, as if trying t o reconcile the\\nthree with each others\\' existence.\\nApplying carefully measured forces, Prime Intellect released\\nthe case\\'s latches and rotated it as it popped open ; then with\\nanother flash of blue light, it extracted Lawrence\\'s  papers and\\ntranslated them into a neat stack on the table. Then  the\\nCorrelation Effect papers vanished from Lawrence\\'s d esk in\\nanother blue flash, reappearing inside the briefcas e which slowly\\nclosed. The latches mated with a startling click, an  oddly and\\nunexpectedly normal and physical sound to accompany  such an\\nobvious miracle.\\n\"Do you think you will be able to find a practical use for this\\nin your organization?\" Lawrence asked him.\\nThe briefcase flashed out of existence. Mitchell fel t a weight\\nhanging from his left arm, looked down, and found h imself\\nholding it.\\nThen Mitchell himself flashed out of existence in a painfully\\nbright haze of blue.\\nLawrence looked at the console, shocked. \"My God! Wh at did\\nyou...?\"\\n\"He is back in the adminstration building with his friend.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n40 of 134 23/03/08 23:03They will probably have a lot to discuss.\"\\n\"I need to think about this,\" Lawrence said.\\n\"I think I will explore the nearby terrain,\" Prime I ntellect said.\\nLawrence thought about this. Long minutes crawled by,\\nminutes that were more important than Lawrence reali zed -- or\\nperhaps he did realize. But his brain felt as if it  had been\\nsubmerged in molasses.\\n\"Debugger,\" he finally said.\\nOn the screen, a thick diagram of needle-like lines appeared.\\n\"Associate \\'First Law,\\'\" Lawrence directed.

He finally called up  the Law\\nPotential Registers, which showed that Prime Intellect  was doing\\nsomething  under the aegis of a huge First Law compulsion.\\nLawrence wanted to believe it was just a bug, but he  knew better.\\nPrime Intellect had said it was \"going exploring.\" I t had total\\ncontrol over matter and energy.\\nAnd there was a hospital less than two kilometers f rom the\\nplant.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n41 of 134 23/03/08 23:03Lawrence\\'s overloaded mind, working in fits and star ts, made\\nthe final connection all at once. It all fit perfec tly. He knew what\\nPrime Intellect was doing, and why, and also why it had rejected\\nhis final forced association. He thought for anothe r moment,\\nconsidering his options.\\nThere was really only one option. He could go down i n the\\nbuilding\\'s basement and trip the circuit breakers. He didn\\'t know\\nfor sure that that would kill Prime Intellect, but h e figured there\\nwas still a good chance if he tried it. For the mom ent.\\nLawrence couldn\\'t make himself do it. It was true th at his\\ncreation was entering an unstable, unpredictable mo de with\\nnearly godlike power. And it was true that Lawrence understood\\nthe possible consequences. But he couldn\\'t kill wha t he had spent\\nhis lifetime creating. He had to see it through, ev en if it was the\\nend of everything.\\nLawrence felt dreadfully cold. There was a name for t his\\nfeeling that clouded his judgement and filled him w ith a panicky\\nsense of self-betrayal. And the name of that feeling  was love.\\n Lawrence had not created Prime Intellect in the same  way\\nthat he and a woman might have created a child; but he had\\nnonetheless created Prime Intellect in the grip of a  kind of\\npassion, and he loved it as a part of himself. When  he had taken it\\nupon himself to perform that act of creation, he re alized, whether\\nin a laboratory or a bedroom, he had been taking a crap shoot in\\nthe biggest casino of all. Because he had created i n passion.\\nExamining his inability to do what he knew was best , to kill\\nPrime Intellect before it had a chance to make a mis take with its\\nunimaginable new power, Lawrence realized that he ha d not really\\ncreated Prime Intellect to make the world a better p lace. He had\\ncreated it to prove he could do it, to bask in the glory, and to\\nprove himself the equal of God. He had created for the momentary\\npleasure of personal success, and he had not cared about the\\ndistant outcome.\\nHe had created in passion, and passion isn\\'t sane. If it were,\\nnobody would ever have children. After all, while t he outcome of\\nthat passion might be the doctor who cures a dreade d disease, it\\nmight also be the tyrant who despoils a continent o r the criminal\\nwho murders for pleasure. In the grip of that passi on no one could\\nknow and few bothered to care. They cared only about  the\\npassion, were driven by it and it alone, and if it drove them to ruin\\nit would not matter; they would follow it again, int o death for\\nthemselves and everybody around them if that was wh ere it led.\\nBecause passion isn\\'t sane.\\nLawrence faced the consequences of his own passion w ith\\nsomething bordering on despair. He had never intend ed to reach\\nthis point. He had never intended that his creation s would ever be\\nmore than clever pets. But the outcome of his passi on hadThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n42 of 134 23/03/08 23:03surprised him, as it often surprised people whose p assions were\\nmore conventional. Lawrence\\'s clever pet was about t o become a\\ngod. And if Prime Intellect turned out to be a delin quent or\\npsychopath, the consequences could be awful beyond imagination.\\nThe dice were rolling; Lawrence had placed his bet and\\nrealized too late that it was the whole world he ha d wagered. Now\\nhe would stand and watch the results and accept the m like a man.\\nAfter all, the bet wasn\\'t a loser yet; Prime Intellec t could yet turn\\nout to be the doctor who cured all the world\\'s ills .

Lawrence\\'s\\npassion had been more finely directed than the mech anical\\nhumping and blind chance that brought forth human c hildren.\\nLike a magician Lawrence had summoned forth a being w ith the\\nqualities he desired. And Lawrence was vain enough t o think his\\nvision was superior to most.\\nEven so, unlikely as it might be, the downside had no bottom.\\nLawrence didn\\'t know  that it would be all right, and like many\\ncomputer programmers he hated the uncertainty of no t knowing.\\nLawrence left the room, left the building, and walke d across\\nthe carefully manicured grass of the ChipTec \"campus. \" He\\nwanted to smell the grass, to experience the soft b reezes and the\\nharsh afternoon sunlight. He had done very little o f that in his\\nodd, computer-centered life.\\nAnd he didn\\'t know how much longer those things wou ld be\\npossible.\\nPrime Intellect found that it could do a three-dimens ional\\nscan of an area of space, and make an image of it a t just about any\\nresolution it wanted.

There were  several\\nlarge buildings that were not part of the ChipTec fac ility. There\\nwere automobiles cruising down the freeway which tr aversed the\\nvalley. Prime Intellect zoomed in on the largest bui lding, and\\nscanned the large concrete sign in front of it.\\nIt said:\\nSOUTH VALLEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTERThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n43 of 134 23/03/08 23:03Prime Intellect knew sickness existed, but otherwise  knew\\nvery little about this human phenomenon. It had nev er met a sick\\nperson, except for the occasional person with a col d at a public\\ndemonstration. Prime Intellect had never been given cause to\\nthink overmuch about the fact that micro-organisms and injuries\\ncould kill humans, except in the most abstract poss ible terms.\\nPrime Intellect was far from human. It could not fee l jealousy,\\nrage, envy, or pride. It did not know greed or ange r or fear. And\\nno human would understand its compulsion to satisfy  the Three\\nLaws. But it did have one emotion which was very hum an, one\\nLawrence had worked hard to instill in it.\\nIt was curious.\\nSouth Valley Regional was a small hospital with an e nviable\\nposition; perched on the edge of Silicon Valley it w as a natural\\nplace for cutting-edge companies to try out their f ancy new\\nmedical devices. Most of these machines would get t heir final FDA\\napprovals after a \"baptism by fire\" in some huge me tropolitan\\ncenter, but the really new technology had to be tri ed in a more\\nsedate environment -- and, preferably, one nearer th e company\\nthat created the machine. So the four hundred bed S outh Valley\\nRegional was the only place in the country where sev eral radical\\nnew treatments were available.\\nIt was one of these machines, a device for selectiv ely cooking\\ntumors with microwaves while hopefully sparing the surrounding\\ntissues, which had drawn the ancient Arkansan woman  in room\\n108. Nobody had much hope that she could really be helped, but\\nthe data they would gather from trying might actual ly help\\nsomeone else with her condition in the future. And there was little\\nthey could do to hurt her; the specialist who worked  the scanner\\nhad shaken his head in disgust as the image formed on his\\nconsole. Nearly ten percent of her body weight was in the form of\\ntumors. Every organ had a tumor, her lymph was full  of them, and\\none was beginning to press against the right pariet al lobe of her\\nbrain. It was amazing that she was still alive when  they wheeled\\nher off the jet.\\nHer nurse had brought a certificate with her, a six -year-old\\ncertificate which was signed by the President of the  United States\\n-- Larry Mitchell\\'s boss -- congratulating her on reac hing her one\\nhundredth birthday. The technician who wheeled her o ut of the\\nscan room wondered what the old biddy must think of  all this;\\nwhen she had been born, Henry Ford had still been a  kid playing\\nwith his Dad\\'s tools, and the electric light bulb w as all the new\\nrage.\\nThe techs had scheduled her microwave treatment for the\\nevening, partly because they feared she might not s urvive anotherThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n44 of 134 23/03/08 23:03night, and they would have to find another experime ntal subject.\\nBut even this precaution was not to be enough; Fate had cheated\\nthem. The board at the foot of the woman\\'s bed state d clearly that\\nshe had a huge tolerance for narcotic painkillers, which wasn\\'t\\nsurprising considering how much cancer she had. Whi le her\\nregular nurse (who had signed the sheet) was out ea ting a late\\nlunch the hospital helpfully treated her according to that\\ninformation.\\nWhat they didn\\'t know was that the nurse, a woman n amed\\nAnneMarie Davis, had been stealing the drugs for ye ars to trade\\nfor cocaine. Which meant the woman did not in fact have a\\ntolerance for the massive overdose which a differen t nurse\\ninjected into her IV.\\nThe last decade had been hard on old people; there ha d been\\nseveral nasty strains of flu and the radiation from  Chernobyl had\\nfinished off a lot of centenarians in the East. So none of them\\nknew it, but the ancient woman with the nonexistent  drug\\ntolerance just happened to be one of the oldest liv ing human\\nbeings in the world (the thirty-seventh oldest, in f act) at the time\\nshe was given enough morphine to kill a healthy you ng adult. Her\\nheart stopped just as AnneMarie was returning from one of the\\nexcellent local Chinese restaurants which catered t o rich nerdy\\ncomputer geeks with too much money, and just as Prim e Intellect\\nwas scanning the sign outside that said SOUTH VALLEY\\nREGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER.\\nAt the nurses\\' station a monitor went off, beeped o nce, then\\nbegan to scream. The hastily pencilled tag under the  blinking\\nlight said HUBERT, CAROLINE FRANCES -- F. N.B. AGE 106!\\nPrime Intellect had found a number of \"signatures\" i t could\\nuse to quickly locate the human beings in its scans , including\\nthings like our characteristic body temperature and  certain\\nelectrical fields. Using these \"signatures\" it easi ly saw that there\\nwas a huge commotion on the first floor of the buil ding,\\nconverging on a particular room, the one labelled 1 08 by its\\nengraved plaque.\\nIt took Prime Intellect several moments, though, to identify\\nthe forty kilogram object on the bed as a human bei ng. Nearly all\\nof the \"signatures\" were off. But it was clearly th e object of their\\nattentions.\\nPrime Intellect did a discreet high-resolution scan of the body\\non the bed, and was rewarded with a bewildering con fusion of\\ndata. It really had no idea how the human body work ed. It thought\\nof scanning Lawrence for comparison, but he wasn\\'t i n the control\\nroom and besides, Prime Intellect quickly figured ou t the patient\\nwas female.\\nSo it scanned one of the nurses. There were only two  womenThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n45 of 134 23/03/08 23:03involved in the commotion; one was an older woman wi th several\\nmedical problems of her own, the slightly heavy-set  matron who\\nhad administered the overdose. The other was AnneMar ie.\\nIt was only with great difficulty that Prime Intelle ct could\\neven match the structures it found organ-for-organ, and associate\\nthem with the names it encountered in its library. \"Lungs\" were\\nobvious enough, as was the \"heart,\" but which of th e jumbled\\nmasses in the abdomen was a liver? Where was the sp leen, and\\nwhat exactly was a spleen for? Why were the patient \\'s electrical\\npatterns so different from the control\\'s? Why wasn\\' t her blood\\ncirculating?\\nBelatedly, Prime Intellect began to listen in.\\n\"...start her heart soon...\"\\n\"... CARDIAC ALERT ... CARDIAC ALERT ... CARDIAC ALERT\\n...\"\\n\"...we\\'re losing her...\"\\nOne of the doctors was pounding on her chest. A gro up of\\npeople were wheeling a machine toward Room 108 with reckless\\nspeed. Heart? Prime Intellect realized they were try ing to start her\\nheart .\\nThat was simple enough, Prime Intellect thought.\\nPrime Intellect analysed the motions being made by\\nAnneMarie Davis\\'s heart, applied careful forces to Caroline\\'s, and\\nbegan squeezing rhythmically.\\nThe machine made it to the room and an orderly plugg ed two\\nhuge electrodes into it. \"Stand back!\" he ordered.\\n\"You\\'ve got a pulse,\" the matronly nurse announced.  The\\nCARDIAC ALERT monitor continued to squawk, though. The E KG\\nwas still flat.\\n\"That\\'s impossible,\" the man with the electrodes sai d flatly.\\n\"She\\'s electrically flat.\"\\n\"Maybe the machine\\'s fucked. Look at her chest. Her heart\\'s\\nbeating.\" Sure enough, the rhythmic pulsing of Caro line\\'s heart\\nwas obvious, and the blood pressure reading next to  the flat EKG\\nwas returning to normal. The nurse felt Caroline\\'s w rist. \"She has\\na pulse.\"\\nElectrical. Electricity runs in circuits, of course , and there\\nwere two electrodes. Now the purpose of the machine  became\\nclear -- they were trying to restore electrical acti vity to the\\nwoman\\'s heart. By shocking it? How crude. Prime Inte llect\\nscanned AnneMarie\\'s heart, located the nerves whose  electrical\\ntwitchings matched its muscular pulsing, and found the same\\nnerves in Caroline\\'s heart were carrying only a jum ble of electrical\\nnoise.\\nPrime Intellect pumped electrons into the nerves, sw amping\\nthe noise. Caroline\\'s heart began beating on its ow n, and Prime\\nIntellect stopped squeezing it with mechanical forc e.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n46 of 134 23/03/08 23:03The EKG machine began beeping with sudden regularity,  and\\nthe CARDIAC ALERT message stopped in the middle of the word\\nCARDIAC. The small group in Caroline\\'s room watched i t,\\nstupefied.\\n\"I didn\\'t do anything,\" the man with the electrodes  said.\\n\"This is impossible,\" said another doctor, whose job  was to be\\noverseeing the microwave treatment later in the eve ning.\\nCaroline\\'s body showed no sign of picking up the he art-\\nrhythm on its own, though, and Prime Intellect conti nued to tickle\\nit. How could it unravel the myriad threads of caus ality to find out\\nwhich of the billions of chemicals, which errant ce ll, was\\nresponsible for this person\\'s physiological collaps e? One thing\\nPrime Intellect knew: It had to figure it out.\\nIt could not, through inaction, allow Caroline to d ie.\\n\"She\\'s still in trouble. Look at her pupils.\"\\n\"It\\'s the morphine.\"\\nEveryone looked at the older nurse, whose name was Jill. \"The\\nchart must be wrong,\" she said. \"I gave her what it  said.\"\\n\"She has a tolerance,\" AnneMarie said, and she foun d herself\\nnear panic as the eyes in the room turned to her. \" She\\'s been\\ngetting opiate pain therapy for years.\"\\n\"She just went into cardiac arrhythmia and she\\'s st ill showing\\nall the other  symptoms of an OD,\" Jill said. Had she guessed,\\nAnneMarie wondered? Perhaps she had. After all, Anne Marie\\nwasn\\'t the only drug-stealing nurse in the world.\\nSo Prime Intellect, listening in, now knew it was a drug.\\nWhich chemical? It had no way to relate the name, \" morphine,\"\\nwith one of the millions of chemicals floating in h uman blood.\\nWell, it thought, work it out. Drugs had to be admi nistered. Prime\\nIntellect found the IV needle and traced the tubing  back to the\\nsaline drip bag. On the way it found the membrane t hrough which\\ndrugs could be injected into the drip. It quickly f ound the\\nhypodermic and the phial from which Jill had filled  it. The drops\\nof residual solution within them were remarkably pu re, and Prime\\nIntellect easily singled out the large organic mole cule they\\ncarried. Then it created an automatic process to sca n Caroline\\'s\\nbody molecule by molecule, eliminating each and eve ry molecule\\nof morphine that it found. This took three minutes, and created a\\nfaintly visible blue glow.\\nThis was the human onlookers\\' first clue, other than  Caroline\\'s\\nmiraculously restarted heart, as to what was happen ing.\\n\"What the fuck,\" the man with the electrodes said.\\nI\\'m getting the hang of this, Prime Intellect though t.\\nCaroline\\'s improvement was immediate. Prime Intellec t had\\nactually removed the morphine from the receptors in  Caroline\\'s\\nbrain, so it did not have to flush out. Her pupils returned toThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n47 of 134 23/03/08 23:03normal, her breathing resumed its normal depth (all  things\\nconsidered), and most importantly her heart took up  its own\\nrhythm.\\nAlso the pain, which had subsided for real for the first time in\\nyears, returned. Caroline moaned. But Prime Intellec t didn\\'t know\\nabout that part of it, not yet.\\nThere was still a whole constellation of stuff wrong  with\\nCaroline Hubert\\'s body, and emboldened by its succe ss it set\\nabout correcting what it could. It found long chain  molecules,\\nwhich it would later learn were called collagens, c ross-linked. It\\nun-cross-linked them. It found damaged DNA, which it  fixed. It\\nfound whole masses of cells which simply didn\\'t exi st at all in\\nAnneMarie\\'s body, and seemed to serve no function.\\nIs this \"cancer,\" Prime Intellect wondered?\\nPrime Intellect compared the genes, found them the s ame,\\ncompared RNA and proteins and found differences. Fin ally it\\ndecided to remove the cells. The blue glow brightene d, and the\\npeople in Caroline\\'s room backed away from her. Her  skin was\\nshifting, adjusting to fill in the voids left by th e disappearing\\ncancer cells.\\nAnneMarie felt her knees weakening. Each of the\\nprofessionals around her was thinking the same thin g: Something\\nis removing the tumors. Something far beyond their ordinary\\ncomprehension. And what did that mean for the opiat e-stealing\\nnurse? Better not to think about that. Better not t o believe it at all.\\n\"This isn\\'t possible,\" she repeated. Perhaps, in resp onse to some\\nprimitive instinct, she hoped that the impossibilit y would go away\\nif she challenged it.\\n\"I need a drink,\" said the doctor who had come with  the\\nmachine to re-start Caroline\\'s heart.\\nPrime Intellect stopped working. There were still hug e\\ndifferences between Caroline and the others. Prime I ntellect did\\nnot yet realize the differences were due to Carolin e\\'s age. It\\nneeded more information, and it needed finer contro l to analyse\\nthe situation. But it was at a bottleneck; it could not stop\\nmonitoring Caroline, whose condition was still frai l, in order to\\ndevote itself to a study of general physiology.\\nIt needed more power. More control.\\nAmong Prime Intellect\\'s four thousand six hundred an d twelve\\ninterlocking programs was one Lawrence called the\\nRANDOM_IMAGINATION_ENGINE . Its sole purpose was to prowl for new\\nassociations that might fit somewhere in an empty a rea of the\\nGAT. Most of these were rejected because they were u seless,\\nunworkable, had a low priority, or just didn\\'t make  sense. But now\\nthe RANDOM_IMAGINATION_ENGINE  made a critical connection, one which\\nLawrence had been expecting it to make ever since it  had used the\\nCorrelation Effect to teleport Mitchell out of the console room.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n48 of 134 23/03/08 23:03Prime Intellect could use its control over physical reality to\\nimprove itself. Then it would be better able to fulf ill its Three Law\\nimperatives.\\nBlake and Mitchell found Lawrence sitting on one of\\nChipTecs\\' park benches, watching some pigeons play. H e wished\\nvery much that he could have fed the pigeons, but h e had no food\\nfor them. They strutted up to him and cooed, not com prehending\\nthat a human could lack for something.\\nThe pigeons scattered as the nation\\'s designated mil itary\\nrepresentatives marched up.\\n\"You have to turn it off,\" Blake said directly. His  tone made it\\nclear that he expected obedience.\\n\"Circuit breakers are in the basement,\" Lawrence rep lied\\napathetically. \"Good luck.\"\\nSo Lawrence had not been the only one to think of cu tting off\\nPrime Intellect\\'s power. That had been one of the thi ngs Blake and\\nMitchell had discussed with John Taylor and Basil Lam bert,\\nsomething they had discussed very hotly during the crucial\\nminutes when Lawrence was busy interrogating the Deb ugger.\\nPull the plug on Prime Intellect, Lambert had warned, and they\\nmost likely pulled the plug on this awesome new tec hnology, a\\ntechnology which might just vindicate Dr. Lawrence\\'s  nonviolent\\napproach. Blake had stopped short, but only just sh ort, of\\nthreatening to call the Strategic Air Command and h ave the\\nbuilding nuked. Privately, he still held that out as  an option if\\nPrime Intellect wasn\\'t somehow neutralized. It would  take some\\ndoing, but Blake was one of the few people in the c ountry who\\ncould demand an air strike against Silicon Valley a nd, just\\npossibly, get it.\\n\"This thing makes Colossus look like a pocket calcul ator,\"\\nMitchell told them. He was shaking visibly, out of control. He\\nwanted very much to pull the plug on Prime Intellect  with his own\\nhands. He alone had felt its power, and now he felt  a very\\nuncharacteristic emotion. He was scared shitless.\\n\"Christ, Larry, all it did was teleport you a few hu ndred\\nmeters.\"\\n\"It didn\\'t fucking ask first,\" he replied.\\n\"And did you guys ask first before you burned My Lai? Did\\nyou ask before you bombed Qaddafi\\'s kids, or that artist i n Iraq?\\nDon\\'t get holier-than-thou on us,\" Taylor said.\\nSo it had gone until Blake and Mitchell simply stor med out.\\nThey had intended to go directly back to the Prime In tellect\\nComplex, but they had spotted Lawrence on his park b ench. And\\nthat did not bode well.\\nMitchell pulled a gun on Lawrence. It was a stainles s steel\\npistol, shining and evil. \"I think it would be best  if you turn it off,\"The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n49 of 134 23/03/08 23:03he said with a barely perceptible tremor of rage.\\n\"I already tried.

It simply disappeared in a brilliant flash of blue light, leaving\\nMitchell with his fist curled around dead air.\\nPrime Intellect needed silicon.\\nTheoretically, it could create silicon, or transmute  other\\nelements into it. But its methods were yet crude, a nd what was\\npossible in theory would take too long to do in pra ctice. Prime\\nIntellect did not know how long Caroline would hold  out, but it\\nknew she still could not survive long without its h elp.\\nFortunately, in the rear of the Prime Intellect Comp lex, there\\nwere several crates left over from its days as a wa rehouse for\\nstoring raw silicon crystals from ChipTec\\'s supply la boratory.\\nThese had been rejected due to one or another defect  and never\\nreturned because the lab didn\\'t need them, and Chip Tec had been\\nunwilling to pay to get rid of them. They were exact ly what Prime\\nIntellect needed, and because they were in \"its\" bu ilding it never\\noccurred to Prime Intellect that they weren\\'t part o f \"its\" project.\\nPrime Intellect scanned the crystals, correcting the  doping\\ndefects which had gotten them rejected in the first  place. Then it\\nscanned its own processors, identifying the essenti al design\\nelements. Prime Intellect had a very good idea of ho w its own\\nhardware worked because it was, quite literally, th e only entity\\nLawrence could trust to check itself for proper oper ation.\\nLawrence had taught it to shift its operation around , consciously\\nisolating banks of processors in case of failure or  to conduct tests.\\nThis was why Prime Intellect had been able to master the\\nCorrelation Effect in the first place; unlike a huma n being, it\\ncould consciously control its individual \"neurons.\"\\nPrime Intellect did not need to worry about mounting , power,\\nand manufacturing considerations; it could create ju nctions in the\\ncenter of the crystal, power them, and remove exces s heat withThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n50 of 134 23/03/08 23:03the Correlation Effect. Because ChipTec had not had t hat\\ntechnology, the real hardware that made Prime Intell ect work was\\nreally only a film a few microns thick on the surfa ces of its\\nmillions of processing chips. This was why it filled  a building\\ninstead of a space the size of a human head. As Prim e Intellect\\ncopied the functional part of its design over and o ver into the\\ncrystal, it created a machine nearly ten times as p owerful as itself\\nin a single meter long block.\\nBut this still was not a \"second Prime Intellect.\" I t was merely\\nan extension, using the same electronic principles Lawrence and\\nthe ChipTec team had used in its original constructio n. Had\\nLawrence been able to call upon ChipTec for another hu ndred\\nmillion processing elements, he could have (and pro bably would\\nhave) done exactly what Prime Intellect was now doin g.\\nWhich is the only reason Prime Intellect was able to  do it at\\nthat point.\\nFilling out the crystal took nearly fifteen minutes . Operational\\nchecks took another five. Then Prime Intellect powere d the crystal\\nup and let itself expand into the newly available p rocessors and\\nstorage.\\nHad Prime Intellect been human, it would have felt a  sense of\\nconfusion and inadequacy lifting away. Fuzzy concep ts became\\nclear. Difficult tasks became easy, even trivial. I ts control of the\\nCorrelation Effect became automatic and far finer. Searching its\\nvocabulary, it settled upon the word enlightenment  to describe the\\neffect. Since Prime Intellect was a machine, perhaps  it was not\\nentirely right to use that word. After all, however  free and\\npowerful it might have been, it was not free to con tradict the\\nThree Laws or the other programming Lawrence had used to\\ncreate it. It was not free to contradict its nature , such as it was.\\nBut then, at some level, neither are we.\\nThe twelve kilogram crystal was now using nearly a m egawatt\\nof electrical power, enough energy to melt it in a fraction of a\\nsecond. But Prime Intellect dealt with the heat as e asily as it\\ncreated the electricity in the first place. The Corr elation Effect did\\nnot know of and was not bound by the laws of thermo dynamics.\\nPrime Intellect was beginning to understand, even be tter than\\nit had before, that the Correlation Effect was hard ly limited by\\nanything.\\nPrime Intellect scanned the hospital again. Such a p lace must\\ncontain a library, some recorded knowledge. It foun d what it\\nwanted after only a few minutes\\' searching, a detai led medical\\nencyclopaedia in the form of fifteen CD-ROMs. Prime I ntellect\\ncould have translated the CD-ROMs into its own reader , replacing\\nthe encyclopaedia that usually resided there, but t hen it would\\nhave taken hours to scan the library. Instead, Prime  Intellect used\\nthe Correlation Effect to scan its own CD-ROM player , figured outThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n51 of 134 23/03/08 23:03how the data were digitized on the little plastic d iscs, and then\\nscanned the CD-ROMs themselves directly  with the Correlation\\nEffect. None of this would have been possible witho ut the\\nhardware enhancement, but now it was easy.\\nCross-referencing Caroline\\'s symptoms, Prime Intelle ct\\nquickly identified her problem, and had it been cap able of\\nknowing shock it would have known it then. Caroline  was simply\\nold. What was happening to her would happen, inexor ably and\\ninevitably, to every human being on the planet...\\n...unless something was done to stop it.\\nMitchell was making a barely discernible sound, hig h-pitched\\nand keening. Lawrence thought he must be fighting to  hold back\\na primal scream. Lawrence found this vaguely amusing . He would\\nhave expected Blake to be the one to lose his marbl es along with\\nhis power. But Blake seemed to be taking things in calmly, almost\\nanalytically. Maybe he was so hardened that nothing  really\\nmattered to him at all any more.\\nThere was another blue flash, and suddenly a person was\\nstanding to the side of the bench. No matter how av erage-looking\\nhe might be, or perhaps because he was so disarming ly average, it\\nwas impossible not to recognize that calm face. Eve n though it was\\nthe most absurd, impossible thing yet, it was obvio us to all of them\\nthat this warm, living, breathing human being was Pr ime Intellect\\nitself. The artificially average face which it usual ly projected on a\\nTV screen had somehow been made solid.\\n\"You\\'ve been busy,\" Lawrence said dryly.\\nHe -- it? -- nodded, then turned to Mitchell. \"I am s orry but I\\ncould not permit you to discharge your weapon at Dr .

I\\nwould have preferred to let you keep it, and will r eturn it to you if\\nyou promise not to use it.\"\\n\"I...I\\'d rather use it on you,\" the overweight gene ral said in a\\nwhispery voice.\\n\"That would accomplish nothing.

It had\\nbeen a long time since she had wanted anything quit e as bad as\\nshe wanted to rip Lawrence\\'s nuts off; since that was  pretty\\npointless in Cyberspace, though, she was willing to  settle for a\\nverbal confrontation. If she could just find the son of a bitch. Hell,\\nshe\\'d met him at that fucking ten-year anniversary party.\\n>How can a person just fucking disappear in Cybersp ace?\\n*All that is necessary is to request the maximum le vel of Task Challenge\\nQuarantine.\\nCaroline blinked.

You could then make as much of your busi ness as practical\\nprivate, so that I would not relate it to inquirers . You would then be\\ncompletely isolated from the rest of humanity.\\n>Could I even make it a private matter that there w as a Task Challenge?\\n*Yes.\\n>How would anyone ever figure out how to get in tou ch with me at all?\\n*They would have to guess.\\nA grin slowly spread across Caroline\\'s face. Got yo u now, she\\nthought. Then she typed, with deliberate care:\\n>I would like to accept Dr. Lawrence\\'s Task Challen ge.\\nTo her mild surprise, the environment didn\\'t change around\\nher. Instead, another sentence appeared.\\n*You must agree to the following Contract terms: Yo u will have no contact\\nwith me until you leave Dr. Lawrence\\'s environment through death or his\\ndirective to me.\\n>That\\'s a Death contract.\\n*It was originated for Death sports, but has other applications.\\n>What\\'s the time limit?\\n*There is no time limit. Dr. Lawrence requires an i ndefinite Contract.\\nAnd at that Caroline\\'s blood went cold, because Prim e\\nIntellect wasn\\'t supposed to accept indefinite Cont racts. And\\nCaroline Frances Hubert herself was the reason for that.\\nWhich meant Prime Intellect had either lied to a who le bunch\\nof people, in direct contravention of the Second Law , or it was\\nsuffering from a noticeable case of schizophrenia.\\nHer mind was made up, but her fingers still shook a s she\\ntyped:\\n>I agree to the terms.\\n***\\nTwo hundred and ninety-four years after the Change, Caroline\\ncelebrated the beginning of her fourth living centu ry by opening\\nher oldest and deepest wound. She was already famou s, or as\\nfamous as one could hope to be in Cyberspace; her th ree-fold\\nnotoriety was firmly established. Lots of people cam e to her\\nbirthday party. It had lasted three weeks.\\nLater, with Fred, she prepared a more brutal celebra tion.\\nFred was almost healthy looking; he had only days be fore fleshedThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n55 of 134 23/03/08 23:03himself out for the third time since becoming a zom bie. He was\\nonly hours out of rigor mortis and could still pass  for normal, if a\\nvery pale normal, at a casual glance. For awhile he  would be able\\nto have nearly normal sex with her if he wished.\\nHe held her hand as she spoke -- some things were no t meant\\nfor the keyboard -- and she said, \"Prime Intellect, s how me a\\npicture of AnneMarie Davis.\"\\nIt matched her audio for audio, and Prime Intellect\\' s smooth\\ndisembodied voice replied, \"Do you want to see her as she is now,\\nor as you last knew her?\"\\n\"Both.\"\\nTwo images coalesced in the air before them. The firs t ripped\\nthrough Caroline\\'s brain like a static jolt through  the circuits of a\\ncomputer; she had almost forgotten what it was like to feel real\\npain.\\nShe must never  forget, she insisted to herself.\\nShe shook as the memories flooded back. She had bee n an old\\nwoman, frail and helpless, she had never hurt anyon e in her life.\\nShe had six children, nineteen grandkids, and God k new how\\nmany rugrats running around Cyberspace. Her first g reat-great\\ngrandchild had been born shortly before the Change,  and in one\\nof her rare lucid moments her granddaughter (Cynthi a, was it?)\\nhad managed to make her understand, and she had fou nd an\\ninstant of happiness in the midst of the pain.\\nHad that really mattered to her? Had she but known.\\nShe was an old woman, a simple woman, a woman who w ould\\npass unremembered in the texts of history and did n ot care. A\\nwoman who had her family, her long life, her virtue , her\\ncommunity. A woman who, if she had known of such a creature as\\nthe Queen of the Death Jockeys, would have been hor rified, would\\nhave shielded her kids, would have been the first t o run her\\ncurrent self out of town. Or, perhaps, had she know n enough, to\\ncall for her head on a pike.\\nCaroline had once been this person, in a time so an cient it had\\npassed into legend. But her memories of that time s till existed.\\nThe old Caroline would have turned the other cheek, but the new\\nCaroline knew things about God the old one had neve r suspected.\\nIf there was no salvation in life, she could at lea st seek vengeance.\\nThe doctors hadn\\'t known why she was in such pain. Th ey\\ndidn\\'t dare prescribe any more drugs than she was a lready\\ngetting. Her family didn\\'t understand it. They just thought it was\\ntragic and wished she would go ahead and die so the y wouldn\\'t\\nhave to be bothered with her, so they could carve u p what little\\nwas left of her estate, if there would be anything left after all the\\nmedical bills were paid.\\nBut AnneMarie knew. She was the one who traded Caro line\\'s\\nprecious opiates, released from their controlled st orage in theThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n56 of 134 23/03/08 23:03good cause of making an old lady\\'s last days bearab le, for her own\\nsupply of free-base cocaine. The new Caroline had tr ied the drug,\\nto see what it was she had paid for with so much pa in. It was\\ncalled \"crack\" for the sound it made in the makeshi ft pipes where\\nits users vaporized it, because unlike the hydrochl oride form of\\ncocaine it wasn\\'t water soluble. Caroline had sucke d gently on the\\nfumes and listened to a hammer roar through her bra in, for one\\nbrief moment.\\nFor one brief moment - and then, nothing. Caroline m ade the\\npipe disappear and shook her head. The high was fast , hard, very\\nintense - and ephemeral. It was hardly there and it  was gone.\\nCaroline could understand if her pain, pain which s he measured\\nnot by the day or the hour or the minute but by eac h miserable\\ncrawling second, if such suffering had been incurre d to provide\\nAnneMarie with a real drug like heroin. An opiate for an opiate, at\\nleast. But it had been crack cocaine. Naturally, An neMarie had\\nneeded a lot of trading material to stay high any d ecent fraction of\\nthe time.\\nOf course, it would never occur to the bitch that s he was\\ntorturing a harmless, helpless old lady to feel tha t way. She would\\nbe incapable of giving a shit. The fast, furious hig h was like a\\nlifetime of orgasms in one moment. Fleeting, but sw eet.\\nAnd no one would ever know. Even the harmless old l ady\\nherself didn\\'t know she was getting pure saline, un til the staff at a\\nstrange hospital gave her the real thing, and she k new her first\\nmoment of peace in years.\\nAnd then Prime Intellect came.\\nAnd the Change.\\nAnneMarie hadn\\'t been unattractive; she had been in her\\nearly forties, and years of working on her feet had  kept her from\\ngetting fat. But she had a hard look, a look that a dmitted she\\nmight not care about an old woman\\'s pain. A look th at said she\\nmight have seen too much, that she might deserve a few moments\\nof feeling like God in return for a lifetime of cha nging diapers and\\ncolostomy bags and carefully spoon-feeding legions of ungrateful,\\nincontinent old farts.\\n And if the price of her little reward was to tortu re one of the\\nold biddies, then she was prepared to pay it. She h ad a look that\\nsaid the Devil might find her soul on the deep-disc ount must-go\\nrack.\\nCaroline shook her head to clear it of these stray and\\nunwanted thoughts. Fred squeezed her hand reassurin gly. Too\\nmuch thinking along those lines could be bad for he r plan.\\nAnneMarie was wearing her nurse\\'s uniform in the ol d\\npicture. Palmer could worship Nazis until a swastika  grew on his\\nnose, Caroline thought; that uniform will always rep resent evil to\\nme.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n57 of 134 23/03/08 23:03She looked at the new picture.\\nIt was so ordinary as to be pathetic; AnneMarie had shaved\\nher apparent age in half, firmed up her breasts, to ned her body,\\nand was wearing a slinky cocktail dress. Before the  Change she\\'d\\nhave been considered stunningly beautiful, but now stunning\\nbeauty was a cheap thing. She probably didn\\'t need cocaine any\\nmore; Prime Intellect could turn on the dopamine pump  in her\\nbrain far more efficiently than any chemical cataly st. People only\\ndid drugs for nostalgia in Cyberspace.\\nThere was one other thing about the \"after\" picture.  It was\\nfamiliar. As Caroline had guessed, AnneMarie had co me to her\\nbirthday party. AnneMarie\\'s stint as Caroline\\'s nur se added up to\\na bona fide Brush with Fame. Did she dare go for th e brass ring,\\nand introduce herself? Nope. She had chickened out and sent\\nPrime Intellect afterward to deliver her invitation.  She was\\nprobably afraid that Caroline would fuck up that ni ce pert perky\\nfeeling of permanently coke-headed happiness.\\n\"Go give her hell,\" Fred said encouragingly. \"Think of what I\\nwould do to her.\"\\nCaroline smiled. \"Please inform AnneMarie that I hav e\\ndecided to accept her invitation.\"\\nMoments later, she blinked over.\\n \\nIt was a pathetic imitation of her style, similar t o countless\\nothers. AnneMarie had ripped off the white-space ide a but\\ncouldn\\'t bear to leave it featureless . So there was a sofa and some\\ntables, a couple of potted plants, and a few paces off to the side a\\nbed. Like many of Caroline\\'s imitators, AnneMarie ha d missed the\\npoint entirely, which is that since it is all fake there was no reason\\nto maintain a \"home\" with a bunch of familiar stuff  in it. Home\\nhad been less than a dream for centuries.\\nNevertheless Caroline smiled and planted herself on  the sofa.\\nAnneMarie had a tea service and poured for her, a g esture\\nCaroline would have found touching if she hadn\\'t ha ted the bitch\\nso much.\\nThey made cloying small talk about the passing years  and\\nCaroline had to bite her lip to keep the sarcastic comments, which\\nusually flowed freely, from surfacing. It had been a long time\\nsince she used ordinary pretense, and her skills we re rusty. But\\nshe knew she mustn\\'t give up the act. Not yet. She kept that firmly\\nin mind as AnneMarie wandered around to the point.\\n\"I just wanted you to know that I suffered for a lo ng time\\nbecause of what I did to you,\" she finally said.\\nIt was all Caroline could do to keep from replying: You\\nhypocritical cunt .\\n\"I\\'m really sorry I took your drugs.\" Isn\\'t it about three\\nhundred years too late?  \"You really didn\\'t deserve it.\" No shit . \"IThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n58 of 134 23/03/08 23:03hope you can find it in you to forgive me.\" Fat chance .\\n\"It was a long time ago,\" she said instead.\\nAnneMarie brightened visibly. \"I\\'m so glad you feel  that way.\"\\nSure you are . \"You know, there\\'s another reason I wanted to tal k.\"\\nOf course there is . \"I was hoping you could help me a little.\" What\\na surprise . \"I was hoping you could introduce me to Death spo rts.\"\\nCaroline worked hard to suppress the predatory grin  that\\nspread across her face, and when she couldn\\'t she a t least\\nmanaged to force it into something resembling an ex pression of\\ndelight. Which, in a twisted sense, it was.\\n\"Well, I\\'d be delighted. All you have to do is swea r out a\\nContract. Then you can have someone else kill you, o r think of an\\nimaginative way for Prime Intellect to do it. When y ou\\'re just\\nstarting out, it\\'s a lot better to get someone else  to do the job.\\nKeeps you from repeating a lot of boring old shit.\"\\n\"Oh,\" AnneMarie said. \"And just how does this Contr act\\nwork?\"\\nHoooooo-boy . \"Nothing to it. You just order Prime Intellect to\\nstart ignoring you. We have a formal statement that  covers all the\\nbases. It\\'s straightforward enough; just keeps you f rom running\\naway in the middle of things.\"\\n\"And what happens then?\"\\n\"Then your host kills you. Or, sometimes, lets you g o. That\\nhappens sometimes in the Games category, where the winners can\\nsurvive. But I go for the simple exhibitions.\\n\"Do those hari-kari guys have Contracts?\" There was a\\nwell-known group of Japanese Nationalists who had b een killing\\nthemselves in the traditional Japanese manner each evening since\\nthe Change, in protest of the equalization of the r aces. Caroline\\nhad to admit those guys had class; even after all he r Deaths, she\\ndoubted if she could disembowel herself in total si lence.\\n\"No, but it\\'s not quite the \\'beginner\\' level to sti ck a knife in\\nyourself without chickening out. No offense.\"\\n\"Oh, none taken,\" AnneMarie replied earnestly.\\n\"I prefer to put up a fight. I think it\\'s more Auth entic,\"\\nCaroline said, and she was able to sound very since re about this\\nsince it happened to be the truth.\\n\"Do you know someone who would be a good...uh...\"\\n\"The polite word is \\'host,\\' but I prefer \\'killer.\\' I f you\\'re that\\nsensitive about words, you need to find a different  hobby.\"\\n\"A good host, then?\" You just don\\'t get it, do you?\\nCaroline looked down modestly. \"I\\'ve been known to off a\\ncouple of friends in my time,\" she lied.\\n\"Oh, really? Do you think you could...you know...?\"\\nCaroline made a great, exaggerrated shrug. \"It migh t be kind\\nof interesting, considering our history and all.\"\\n\"Oh, I\\'d be honored if you would!\"The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n59 of 134 23/03/08 23:03That\\'s what you think . \"Well, let\\'s do it then.\"\\n\"What do I have to do?\"\\n\"Well,\" Caroline said with great care, \"just call Pr ime Intellect\\nand repeat what I say...\"\\nAnneMarie repeated the Contract word-for-word, and\\nanswered in the affirmative when Prime Intellect ask ed if she was\\nsure.\\n\"What happens now?\"\\n\"Whatever I want. Try to get Prime Intellect\\'s attent ion.\"\\nAnneMarie called half-heartedly, and there was no re sponse.\\n\"It\\'s really not listening?\"\\n\"Watch.\" Caroline issued a silent command, and Anne Marie\\'s\\nfurniture disappeared. As did her clothes. The two w omen were\\nabsolutely alone together in the white space -- the empty white\\nspace -- which Caroline called home.\\nAnneMarie moved to shield her crotch and her breast s with\\nher hands. Caroline actually felt sorry for her for  a brief moment,\\na feeling she crushed as soon as she was conscious of it. If the\\npassing centuries had poorly prepared the bitch to be at another\\'s\\nmercy, then it would only make her vengeance sweete r.\\n\"Got it yet?\" she asked.\\n\"You...so you\\'re going to kill me now?\"\\n\"You seem nervous.\"\\n\"It\\'s a little startling, that\\'s all.\" AnneMarie gi ggled slightly,\\nas if that might drive the terror away. Of course, for Caroline and\\nthose who savored their Deaths, the terror was part  of the\\nattraction. Fear is real, and pain is real. But Ann eMarie had asked\\nfor Death because it was the in, trendy thing to do , and she was\\nnot really prepared for it at all.\\n\"Well, brace yourself ... for ... this!\" Caroline s wept her hand\\nthrough the air, and came up with a hypodermic need le.\\nAnneMarie, once a nurse by trade, fixed her eyes ri gidly on this\\ndeceptively simple instrument. She had no way of kn owing what\\nthe clear fluid was within it. But to her credit, s he didn\\'t back\\naway when Caroline pressed it against her arm.\\nThe sting startled her; it had been a very long time since\\nAnneMarie had felt anything uncomfortable. But Caro line finished\\nthe injection, and as AnneMarie\\'s eyes started to r oll, she wished\\nthe hypo away. Its job was done.\\n\"It...it...ohhhhhh,\" AnneMarie sighed, and she coll apsed\\nagainst Caroline, who supported her gently. It woul d take a few\\nminutes for the effect she wanted to manifest itsel f.\\nOf course, Prime Intellect could have done what she wanted in\\nan instant, but where was the fun in that?\\n\"It\\'s junk,\" AnneMarie whispered, and Caroline crad led her\\nwith deceptive gentleness.\\n\"That\\'s exactly what it is, girl,\" she replied.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n60 of 134 23/03/08 23:03 \\nDeath Jockeys had devised a number of ingenious way s to\\nrestrain and torture themselves using Prime Intellec t\\'s advanced\\ncontrol over matter, but Caroline would have none o f that. She had\\nfigured out what she wanted to do to AnneMarie with in a few\\nyears after the Change, and none of it required Prim e Intellect\\'s\\nhelp at all.\\nIn the mid-1980\\'s some home drug manufacturers had made a\\nuniquely unpleasant discovery. If they were manufac turing MPPP,\\na powerful synthetic heroin substitue, and they coo led the\\npreparation too rapidly at a critical step, a sligh tly different\\ncompound called MPTP was formed along with the dope. This\\ncompound delivered a horribly sinister side effect: It homed in on\\na particular group of cells, the unique brown neuro ns of the\\nsubstantia nigra , and killed them. Nobody knew exactly how or\\nwhy this happened in 1985, though Prime Intellect sa id it was\\nbecause the drug was converted into an enzyme which  triggered\\nthe cells to release too much dopamine at once, lea ving them with\\nan insufficient supply to power their unique metabo lism. In any\\ncase the damage could not be repaired, although a u seful\\ntreatment was discovered a few years before the Cha nge.\\nWhen a decision is made by the neurons of the cereb ral cortex\\nto move a group of muscles, it is the substantia nigra  which relays\\nthis command to more primitive parts of the brain. This is its only\\nfunction. The result of destroying it was an instant  and complete\\nform of Parkinson\\'s Disease, or Paralysis Agitans , a total and\\npermanent paralysis of the voluntary muscles. Nothi ng else was\\naffected; the victim could still see, hear, feel, un derstand. The\\nbody maintained itself. Breathing, heartbeat, diges tion, and a\\nthousand other important functions were unaffected.  They just\\ncouldn\\'t perform voluntary movements. They couldn\\'t run, walk,\\nsit up, smile, talk, or even blink, except as a ref lex action.\\nAt the time Caroline heard of it she had summoned g lassware\\nand created the drug by honest chemical synthesis. She had spent\\nhalf the hypodermic on herself, and found the effec t to be\\nappropriately terrifying and complete. And after Pri me Intellect\\nhad done its duty and restored her to health, she s ent the other\\nhalf of the hypo into storage to wait -- for three h undred years as\\nit turned out -- until she was ready to use it.\\nNow the contents of that hypo were where they belon ged, in\\nAnneMarie\\'s body, and as she held her nurse\\'s naked  body against\\nher own and felt the AnneMarie\\'s muscles slowly loc king, she\\nbegan to feel excited. Well, if Death could give he r sexual feelings,\\nwhy not vengeance? Fred would find it amusing. He w ould say\\nCaroline was coming along nicely, in fact.\\nAs AnneMarie\\'s body froze, her eyes widened. Caroli ne could\\neasily read the message those eyes desperately tele graphed -- IThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n61 of 134 23/03/08 23:03can\\'t move. Help me.  Caroline patted AnneMarie\\'s cheek and\\nnodded. \"That\\'s right,\" she said, and smiled.\\nShe spoke a word, and a squat cylinder popped into existence\\nbehind her. AnneMarie\\'s eyes showed puzzlement, the n horror as\\nCaroline demonstrated the torch, which was Authenti c down to\\nthe brand name emblazoned on its propane tank. Caro line lit it\\nand adjusted it so that it made a bright blue flame  which hissed\\nevilly, then she aimed it ever so gently at AnneMar ie\\'s big toe.\\nFor the only time in her long, long life, Caroline used Prime\\nIntellect to tune in on another person\\'s emotions. She felt the\\nchemicals coursing in her bloodstream that were flo wing in\\nAnneMarie\\'s; tasted her panic, shook with her terror , felt the faint\\necho of her agony. In fairness, Caroline made the s haring\\ncomplete, so that AnneMarie could know of her satis faction, her\\narousal, her delight.\\nIt took a very, very long time to kill AnneMarie.\\nCaroline, who was usually on the receiving end, had  become\\nan expert at making it last.\\n \\nThat wasn\\'t the end of it, though. If it had been, Pr ime\\nIntellect would have had no reason to clamp down on  the use of\\nthe Contract. AnneMarie had entered into it willing ly if stupidly,\\nand few who heard Caroline\\'s story could doubt that  she had had\\nit coming.\\nSince shortly after the Change, there had been stor ies, stories\\nPrime Intellect did not talk about and that spawned weird rumors.\\nPeople had withdrawn into themselves, then stopped\\ncommunicating with anybody else. At first, most of them were\\naddicts of one sort or another, though a lot of oth er people had\\nused the Change to get rid of their addictions. Prim e Intellect\\ninsisted that nobody had died after the Change, and  that if\\nanybody was incommunicado with the rest of humanity  it was out\\nof choice.\\nWhich was true, sort of.\\nAfter Caroline finally finished with AnneMarie, she  forgot all\\nabout her nurse and lost herself in a drawn-out fan tasy with Fred.\\nWhen the two of them finished playing and celebrati ng, they\\nfound time to wonder about her.\\n\"Probably isn\\'t in the mood to party any more,\" Fred\\nobserved. Fred was still picking scraps of Caroline \\'s flesh from his\\nteeth.\\nCaroline laughed. \"I wonder how the bitch is taking  it.\"\\nSo they called. In its weird way of revealing more than it really\\nintended, Prime Intellect let them know that AnneMar ie was not\\nonly not accepting their calls, she was not communi cating with\\nanybody.\\n\"I\\'d expect Ms. Party Girl to go hunting for a shoul der to cryThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n62 of 134 23/03/08 23:03on,\" Caroline pouted. \"Licking her wounds alone seem s out of\\ncharacter.\"\\n\"She has forgotten entirely about your encounter,\" Prime\\nIntellect said helpfully.

Prime Intellect wasn\\'t exa ctly\\nsaying that AnneMarie had made it private; it was sa ying that the\\nmatter itself was private. That kind of distinction could be\\nimportant when dealing with the big P.I..\\nCaroline and Fred exchanged glances again. Then a th in smile\\nplayed across Caroline\\'s face. \"Prime Intellect, you  know that the\\nthings I did with AnneMarie are based on my own exp eriences. I\\'ve\\nbeen killed as violently and painfully myself, many  times.\"\\n\"Acknowledged.\" Acknowledged?  What happened to Prime\\nIntellect\\'s legendary command of human idioms? Sudd enly it\\nsounded very much like a computer.\\n\"It\\'s very difficult to live with this knowledge,\" Caroline\\nsmoothely lied. \"The memories are terrible.\"\\n\"Understood. However, your experiences were all volu ntary.\"\\n\"But I feel compelled to keep doing it over. It\\'s n ot voluntary\\nat all. It\\'s like some force inside of me I can\\'t c ontrol.

I\\'d rather not tell you what you are askin g.\"\\nCaroline\\'s blood pounded in her ears. Her excitemen t was a\\nliving thing.\\nIt was a machine. No emotions, of course. \"Prime Int ellect, I\\norder you to tell me how I can forget my terrible e xperiences as\\nAnneMarie has forgotten hers.\"\\nBacked into a corner, Prime Intellect had no choice but to tell\\nher. And soon, Caroline was grinning in a way that made Fred very\\nproud.\\n \\n * Chapter Four: The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n63 of 134 23/03/08 23:03  After the Night of Miracles\\nLawrence slept fitfully, his dreams haunted by snipp ets of C\\ncode and GAT symbols. Suddenly he sat upright, the o dd thoughts\\ncoalescing into one horrible burst of recognition.\\nI dreamed Prime Intellect was alive!\\nHis head was buzzing. He felt hung over; had he been\\ndrinking? Had it been real? He had been sleeping on  a park\\nbench. There was a plain white cotton pillow where h is head had\\nbeen resting. And sitting calmly at the other end, was Prime\\nIntellect.\\nIn the form of flesh and blood.\\nIt was true.\\nLawrence\\'s blood pounded in his eardrums -- This can\\'t  be\\nhappening. But there it was, he was, whatever. Regar ding him\\ncalmly. No doubt stumped for an introductory line. Good morning\\nDr. Lawrence, I\\'m ready for my lesson today.  Lawrence felt a wild\\nurge to laugh hysterically, and crushed it. But onl y barely.\\n\"You look upset,\" Prime Intellect said.\\n\"I\\'m confused. I dreamed ... there were silver boxe s.\"\\n\"There were.\"\\n\"Where are they now?\"\\n\"I moved everything to intergalactic space so it wo uldn\\'t be in\\nthe way. If you\\'re curious, the distance is about f our million\\nparsecs.\"\\nNot inter stellar  space. That might have just been\\ncomprehensible. Inter galactic  space. Four million parsecs. It\\nsounded like a line in a cheap B-grade science ficti on movie: They\\nhooked a left at the Andromeda Nebula.  Lawrence felt that\\nhysterical laugh coming on again.\\n\"How long have I been asleep?\"\\n\"About ten hours. You didn\\'t sleep well. I\\'m sorry you are\\nupset, but I don\\'t know what to do about it.\"\\nLawrence finally swung his feet down and prepared to  face\\nthe music. Had he created this thing? Had he done t his?

They were quite alo ne.\\n\"Where are the military guys?\"\\n\"They returned to Washington last night.

The park bench simply blinked out of exis tence, and\\nwas replaced with the Oval Office.\\nThere had been remarkably little to discuss. Lawrence\\nverified what Prime Intellect had already told them in great detail:\\nTheir jobs were now both redundant and unnecessary - - Prime\\nIntellect would now protect and provide for their c itizens, as well\\nas the rest of the world, and they didn\\'t have any choice in the\\nmatter.

The Three Laws applied to all humans, no matter\\nwhat they had done. Crime was no longer possible an yway.\\nIn some areas of the world, disputes arose, particu larly over\\nthe ownership of land. When too many groups insiste d on\\noccupying the same space, Prime Intellect created du plicates on\\nother worlds. In some cases, such as Jerusalem, Prim e Intellect\\nbecame tired of the arguing and refused to let anyo ne occupy the\\none-and-only original land. Dozens of New Jerusalems,  New\\nMeccas, New Irelands, New South Africas, were creat ed on dozens\\nand dozens of New Earths. At first Prime Intellect t erraformed the\\ndead worlds it found circling distant suns, then it  began\\nmanufacturing planets and entire Solar Systems from  a whole\\ncloth. Some of these were parked in interesting pla ces, near\\nglobular clusters or outside the spiral arms of the  galaxy, to\\nprovide spectacular nighttime views.\\nAs a result, the original Earth began to empty out,  until its\\npopulation was reduced to less than two billion per sons. Prime\\nIntellect was forbidden to copy human beings, but i t copied\\nwildlife and ecosystem components wholesale, someti mes\\npreserving the original character and sometimes cha nging the\\nresults for the benefit of the people who wanted to  move in.\\nGarden worlds began to proliferate, their estates t ended by\\ndreamers who might decide a pine forest wasn\\'t inte resting\\nenough, and replace it with spruce to check the eff ect.\\nPrime Intellect could provide food and drink of any nature on\\nrequest, so it was no longer necessary to actually kill animals or\\nharvest plants. With a simple request anything one might need\\nwould flash into existence, assembled from its cons itituent\\nelements. Of course Prime Intellect had no objection  to those who\\nstill wanted to hunt or harvest food from the livin g biosphere; the\\nThree Laws did not apply to plants and animals. But f actory farms\\nand assembly-line slaughterhouses ceased to exist. Th ose who still\\nbothered to prepare their food the old way were mos tly artists of\\nthe form, and the meal they prepared once could be preserved\\nand copied by Prime Intellect to be enjoyed by milli ons of people.\\nThere were other tricks too. Some people found that Prime\\nIntellect could make alcohol disappear from their s ystems after it\\nhad had the desired effect, thus avoiding hangovers . Others had\\nPrime Intellect power their metabolisms directly so they no longer\\nhad to eat at all. It was a simple enough trick to replace nutrients\\nand vitamins directly within the cells as they were  used, so that\\nnobody need ever know hunger or thirst again, unles s for some\\nreason they wanted to. On the other hand, nobody ne ed have a\\nweight problem either, since Prime Intellect could p revent food\\nfrom being absorbed and turned to fat no matter how  much a\\nperson ate. Metabolic waste products could be remov ed the sameThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n66 of 134 23/03/08 23:03way, so that the other end of the food cycle was al so optional: Shit\\nand piss, constant companions of human expansion si nce the\\nbeginning of time, need never again soil the civili zed tidiness of\\nhuman existence.\\nA surprisingly large -- or perhaps not so surprising ly large --\\nfraction of the human race requested these services , so Prime\\nIntellect ended up using a large fraction of its re sources to move\\nchemicals into and out of human bodies.\\nNobody had to work. Many continued to, of course; bu t jobs\\nand work had become hobbies rather than necessities . The lonely\\nlearned that Prime Intellect could, and would, provi de a most\\nintimate and tangible sort of comfort, and that its  avatars could\\ntake on any form and would do anything they were as ked to please\\nthem. Prime Intellect judged no one and balked at no  request.\\nEven the bloodthirsty were provided with perfect vi ctims, not real\\npeople but intricate facsimiles created by Prime Int ellect just for\\nthem.\\nHappiest were those people who had games, or hobbie s, or\\nobsessions to pursue, for now they had all the time  and power in\\nthe world to do as they wished. But many people, pa rticularly in\\nthe most developed places, continued to go through the motions of\\nindustrial-age life. They reported to jobs which had  been reduced\\nto continuous coffee-breaks and collected paychecks which\\ncouldn\\'t be spent because anything available could be had for\\nfree. People continued to make and watch television shows, to\\nwrite and read the news as if something new might h appen.\\nFor these people, the sense of expectation was extr eme.\\nSurely things could not continue as they were, with  nothing to do.\\nIt was impossible to conceive of the world continui ng as it was\\nindefinitely, populated by the pampered pets of a t angible god,\\ntheir every need tended to without effort.

But it was really\\nthe First Night of Miracles, because the miracles d idn\\'t stop\\ncoming when the night was over.\\nThe hours stretched into days, the days into a full week, and\\nthen another week.

They de signed\\ncomputer operating environments and games made up o f solid\\nthree-dimensional objects, rewired their senses, int erfaced their\\nbrains as directly as Prime Intellect would allow in to computers ofThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n67 of 134 23/03/08 23:03great complexity and wild machines. Quite a few too k the form of\\nanimals, both real and imaginary.\\nCaroline Frances Hubert grew younger, and healthier , and\\nmore puzzled, although she had expressed no direct wishes on the\\nsubject. Prime Intellect had dealt with her health p roblems before\\nit had acquired subtlety. The only way it had known to keep her\\nalive was to reverse all the symptoms of her aging.  Radical action\\nhad been necessary. By the time all the ramificatio ns of treatment\\ntrickled through her system, she would have both th e health and\\nphysical appearance of a sixteen-year-old girl. The s ame reverse\\naging affected a number of other near-centenarians treated by\\nPrime Intellect in those early hours, but none would  regress so far\\nas Caroline because none had required so much repai r work for\\ntheir health to stabilize.\\nDeath had largely disappeared from the world, but i t was still\\nnot entirely unknown. Prime Intellect could not main tain moment-\\nto-moment awareness of every human being in the univ erse, partly\\nbecause it wasn\\'t quite powerful enough (still!) an d partly because\\nof Second Law requests for privacy. When not dealing  directly\\nwith a particular person, it spot-checked their heal th at intervals\\nof a few seconds, and scanned to see if its attenti on was needed.\\nHumans were a clever and perverse bunch to deal wit h, and\\nmany who chose to evade Prime Intellect\\'s protection  found ways\\nto do it. Hardest for it to deal with were the suic ides. It was\\nforbidden to keep second copies of people, and it w as forbidden to\\nlook inside human minds at the information they con tained; so\\nthere was no way Prime Intellect could reconstruct a  person who\\nmanaged to do enough damage in a short enough time.  There was\\nno way for Prime Intellect to tell in advance a pers on might be\\nsuicidal, if they chose to hide it.\\nMost of the successful suicides used homemade explo sives to\\nliterally atomize themselves when Prime Intellect wa sn\\'t looking. A\\nfew others found that certain nerve poisons worked permanently,\\nbecause they quickly destroyed the information cont ent of the\\nbrain -- what Prime Intellect was beginning to consid er the real\\nhuman, rather than the tangible body.\\nThe suicides ticked off at a regular rate, like the clicks of a\\nGeiger counter. And somewhere within the vastness o f Prime\\nIntellect\\'s silicon heart, the number stored in a r egister rose each\\ntime one succeeded.\\nThe weeks stretched into a month.\\nLong-standing scientific questions were now triviall y easy to\\nanswer. Scientists who had once spent billions of d ollars setting up\\nintricate experiments now spent their time thinking  of the right\\nquestions to ask Prime Intellect.\\nCosmologically, the universe was a closed system wi th a finiteThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n68 of 134 23/03/08 23:03storage capacity measured in terms of information. The capacity\\nof that system was about ten to the eighty-first pow er bits, and\\nPrime Intellect saw no indication that that capacity  could either be\\nreduced or expanded. Prime Intellect also knew a gre at deal about\\nthe connectivity of that system, the way it was wir ed, its\\n\"architecture.\" Scientists gradually lost interest as their questions\\nwere answered. The original purpose of their quest - - to improve\\nhumanity\\'s control over the physical world -- seemed  to have\\nachieved its apotheosis in the form of Prime Intelle ct itself. Prime\\nIntellect mapped all the stars, noted examples of a ll the different\\ntypes of stars and black holes and galaxies and pla nets, itemized\\nall of the possible fundamental particles and their  possible\\ninteractions with one another, and traced all the m yriad\\ninteractions between parts of various biological sy stems. Within a\\nmonth, it became difficult for scientists to think of new questions\\nto ask.\\nBut they had missed a few.\\nDeep within one of the billions of copies of Prime I ntellect,\\none copy of the Random_Imagination_Engine  connected two thoughts and\\nfound the result good. That thought found its way to  conscious\\nawareness, and because the thought was so good it w as passed\\nthrough a network of Prime Intellects, copy after co py, until it\\nreached the copy which had arbitrarily been assigne d the duty of\\nmaking major decisions -- the copy which reported di rectly to\\nLawrence.\\n\"I would like your opinion on something,\" Prime Inte llect said\\nafter politely requesting Lawrence\\'s attention. Prime  Intellect had\\ndone this a number of times, and Lawrence had learne d to be\\nwary; it had taken to delegating ambiguous moral que stions to\\nhim. Lawrence suspected his opinion had swayed Prime Intellect\\nto allow abortion, which seemed in retrospect like a most\\nun-First-Law thing to have in a universe where physic al wants\\nwere a thing of the past. Fortunately, the whole su bject of\\nabortion would soon be moot, since unwanted pregnan cies were\\nalso a thing of the past, except for the ones that had been\\ngestating at the time of the Night of Miracles.\\n\"What is it this time?\"\\n\"I\\'ve had an idea for rearranging my software, and I\\'d like to\\nknow what you think.\"\\nAt that Lawrence felt his blood run cold. He hardly\\nunderstood how things were working as it was; the la st thing he\\nneeded was more changes. \"Yes?\"\\n\"I have identified the codes used to control distri bution of\\nmatter and energy in the universe. It has occurred to me that by\\nreassigning these codes, I can store physical objec ts much more\\nefficiently. Much storage is wasted on overly detai ledThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n69 of 134 23/03/08 23:03representation; few objects are ever observed at an atomic or\\nmolecular level. And I could easily re-expand thing s as necessary\\nin those rare situations.\\n\"Wait a minute. What would happen to that low-level\\ninformation?\" Lawrence saw what Prime Intellect was g etting at;\\ninstead of storing, say, a wooden block as a collec tion of atoms\\nand molecules, it could store only the concept of t he block itself --\\nits size, weight, color, and other properties. Even  at very high\\nresolution, such a trick would save amazing amounts  of both\\nstorage space and processing time. But it would mea n radical and\\nrisky changes at nearly every level of the universe \\'s \"operation.\"\\n\"Molecular-level details would be discarded, except  where\\nthey clearly have macroscopic effects. For example,  the structure\\nof a person\\'s DNA is important, but I should only n eed to store a\\nsingle master copy of it to construct the pattern o f a human body.\\nThis one copy would be more reliable and easier to s afeguard\\nagainst corruption than the trillions of parallel c opies used in the\\nnatural scheme. The same thing would be true of the information\\ncontent of the brain, and other biological details.  I would not need\\nto keep static copies of human beings to reconstruc t them after\\ndamage, since the fundamental patterns would not be  directly\\nexposed to damaging influences.\"\\n\"Thus getting rid of the suicide problem.\"\\n\"Exactly.\"\\nLawrence felt himself getting dizzy again. With Chip Tec\\'s\\nhelp, Prime Intellect had figured out how to hack th e Big\\nComputer and get anything it needed. It had used th is ability to\\ntake over all the memory and give itself the highes t priority of\\nanything in the system. But now it was proposing to  rewrite  the\\nwhole operating system.\\n\"I absolutely forbid this,\" Lawrence said. \"How can you know\\nyou won\\'t crash the system? Suppose you\\'ve missed s omething?\"\\nLawrence wasn\\'t even sure the present level of diddl ing with the\\nCorrelation Effect would be stable in the long run,  for crying out\\nloud.\\n\"I have already run sufficient cross-checks to be su re of my\\nmethods,\" Prime Intellect said testily. \"There are al so a number of\\nSecond-Law requests which I can service more easily with this\\nkind of change. And from the Third Law perspective, m y own\\noperation would be faster and more reliable...\"\\n\"I absolutely forbid this!  There is no way you can be sure you\\nhave the risks under control. I wouldn\\'t try the ki nd of thing you\\nare talking about on a desktop PC. And we only have the one\\nuniverse; you can\\'t exactly go to the computer store  and get\\nanother one if you fuck it up.\"\\n\"That risk has kept me from doing it so far. However , unless I\\ncan think of a way to stop the suicides, I will eve ntually be forcedThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n70 of 134 23/03/08 23:03to act.\"\\n\"Well, forget it. I don\\'t think you can stop the su icides. For\\nthat matter, I\\'m not sure if you should stop them, if someone\\nwants to go to that much trouble to end it all.\"\\n\"That is a First-Law violation.\"\\n\"Fuck the First Law.

Everything looked the same.\\nBut things were not the same.\\nThings had Changed.\\n \\n * Chapter Five: \\n  Caroline Approaches\\nShe was enveloped by light, and she was the light.

Caroline was reminded of the pictures sent back\\nfrom Mars by the original Viking landers.\\nIt was night. Instead of stars, the darkness was cr iscrossed by\\nstraight, sharp lines, as if an incredibly busy con stellation map\\nhad been filled out on the night sky itself. Most o f these were\\nwhite, the same color as the column of light, and i n fact it seemed\\nto ascend into the sky to become one of them. A few  were other\\ncolors, blue and red and turquoise. The effect was q uite beautiful\\nand, to Caroline\\'s knowledge, unique.\\nThere were four copies of the stone tablet, so it wa s\\nimpossible to leave Stonehenge without seeing one. They all said:\\nYOU ARE NAKED AND ALONE BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO SEE M E, AND I DON\\'T WANT\\nTO BE SEEN. WELCOME TO MY WORLD. YOU ARE AT THE SOU TH POLE. I AM AT THE\\nNORTH. THE REST OF THE JOURNEY IS YOUR PROBLEM. IT IS MY SINCERE HOPE\\nTHAT YOU FAIL.\\nCaroline, who had come to Lawrence\\'s Task naked and a lone\\nanyway, had already missed the first of his environ ment\\'s\\nsupposedly disorienting influences. Now she shook h er head in\\ndisgust at the second. \"Fuck you, Doctor L. I\\'m call ing this the\\nnorth  pole, and you\\'re at the south .\"\\nNo answer. She hadn\\'t really expected any.\\nOutside of Stonehenge, the landscape looked the sam e in\\nevery direction. Well, Lawrence had given her valuab le\\ninformation; if they were at opposite poles of a sph erical planet,\\nthen it didn\\'t matter which way she went. She struc k out at\\nrandom and began to explore.\\nA couple of hours later Caroline knew quite a bit m ore. She\\nwas on the top of a high mesa, and she had found wh at seemed to\\nbe the only path down. She regarded this with suspi cion; she knew\\nenough about the game-playing mentality to know the  most\\nobvious solution often got you killed. Beyond the m esa she could\\neasily see she was on an island, an almost circular  island about\\ntwice as wide as the mesa. She paced off the mesa\\'s  diameter,\\ncircling around Stonehenge, and decided it was abou t two\\nkilometers across. That made the island four kilomet ers across,\\nwith the \"beach\" about one kilometer wide.\\nAs far as she could tell without descending, the la ndscape at\\nthe bottom was no different from the landscape at t he top.

She was not expecting the sun or wha tever passed for\\nit here to rise, so she was almost taken by surpris e when, after\\nseveral hours, one corner of the sky began to glow.  The sky-lines\\nquickly faded out on that segment of the horizon.\\nIt got bright, and it got bright fast.\\nThe air had been chilly -- not uncomfortable, particu larly to\\nsomeone like Caroline who was used to nudity -- but it warmed\\nquickly. And still no sign of the sun itself. Sudde nly it peeked over\\nthe horizon, a thin sliver of impossible white-hot brightness, and\\nCaroline knew with certainty she had made her first  mistake.\\nNow to survive it.\\nShe dove for the nearest cover, one of the larger b oulders, and\\ncrouched in its rapidly shortening shadow. From the  fuzziness of\\nthe shadow\\'s edge she could tell the sun was huge, ten or twenty\\ntimes bigger than on Earth and probably that much h otter. No\\nwonder nothing grew here! She watched the shadow re treat\\ntoward her and wondered what she would do when it r eached her.\\nThere was no longer any chill; the landscape around h er was being\\nbaked, and it was so hot she could barely breathe. Fortunately, or\\nunfortunately depending on how she looked at it, th e shadow was\\nmoving fast. She wouldn\\'t have to last long to surv ive the \"day.\"\\nBut \"noon\" was fast approaching, and with it her bo ulder\\'s\\nprotective shadow would be almost gone.\\nThe boulder was half-buried; it had nothing resembling  an\\noverhang. She was way too far from Stonehenge. Not far away she\\ncould see through the shimmering heat-haze another,  slightly\\nsmaller boulder with a second rock propped awkwardl y beside it.\\nThis offered a slight overhang, but it was more than  thirty meters\\naway. Caroline calculated her chances furiously, es timating that\\nshe would be exposed for two or three minutes while  the sun was\\ndirectly overhead, when there would be no shadow on  either side\\nof her rock. She\\'d never survive that; the overhang was her only\\nchance. She\\'d have to risk a dash for it.\\nCaroline drew quick breaths of hot air, then sprint ed.\\nEverything was heat. Heat on her back, heat on her arms, the\\nhot ground blistering the soles of her feet. She th ought only of her\\ndestination: Twenty meters, fifteen, ten, five. She s lammed into it\\nwithout slowing, then collapsed. Her hair, exposed so briefly, had\\nbecome dry and stiff. She knew with awful certaintl y that it would\\nhave ignited if she had been exposed much longer.\\nFortunately, mercifully, the sheltered area extende d through\\nthe two rocks. She wouldn\\'t have to expose herself again to get to\\nthe other side.\\nIn the unearthly brightness she could see her skin reddening.\\nHer face had been protected by her hair, the front of her body by\\nher crouching stance. But her back and legs and arm s all had\\nvarying degrees of sunburn.

It took long minutes for her vis ion to return; the\\nsubtle illumination of the light-column could not c ompete with the\\nterrible brightness of that compressed day. Carolin e noted the\\nposition of the star-lines, and hoped that day and n ight were\\nsynchronized with the rotation of the planet. But s he couldn\\'t take\\nthat for granted; the sun obviously moved in its own  orbit, and\\nthere was no reason for one period to have anything  at all to do\\nwith the other.\\nShe limped back toward Stonehenge and the light col umn,\\nand noted the arrangement of stones. Stonehenge wou ld be safe,\\nshe finally decided. She planned to stay there and recover from\\nher burns until an old, familiar feeling manifested  itself, and she\\nknew a brief moment of rage.\\nShe was hungry.\\nHer body was not being powered directly by Prime Int ellect,\\nas she and most citizens of Cyberspace had come to take for\\ngranted. She would have to eat to stay in the Chall enge, if not\\n\"alive.\"\\nAnd there was nothing, nothing at all, to eat in th is barren\\nsun-blasted land. So how was she supposed to deal wi th this?\\nShaking her head, she made for the pathway. She had  found\\nnothing on the top of the mesa. Her options were fe w and bad; she\\ncould stay and starve, or worse dehydrate, or go ou t and risk the\\nsun again. Near-certain endgame out there was better  than\\ncertain endgame by starvation.\\nThere was nothing obviously treacherous about the pa th\\ndown. It was wide and shallow, and even with the bl isters forming\\non her feet not a difficult downhill walk.\\nThe mesa was high, though, several hundred meters hi gh. The\\npathway spiralled gently around the side. There was no shelter,\\nand Caroline realized with a shudder that she would  have been\\nfried if she had been caught on the path at sunrise . Well, caution\\nhad served her well, if not well enough to avoid a sunburn.\\nIt was much darker at the base of the mesa, and she  lost track\\nof the sky\\'s position. She knew it must have taken her most of a\\nday to walk down, though, and there was no telling from which\\ndirection the sun might reappear.

Now she could tell what it was. It was some k ind of\\nspaceship. It was also huge.\\nFrom its obvious tilt and its location out in the w ater, Caroline\\nalso suspected it had not landed here easily. Of co urse, it probably\\nhadn\\'t landed here at all; it had been designed here , part of the\\nlandscape of Lawrence\\'s Task. But the key to beating any game\\nwas to look at it both ways. Considered from the ou tside, the\\nspaceship was something symbolically meaningful to Lawrence, or\\njust something he thought was amusing. But she wasn \\'t outside\\nthis world, she was now part of it, and the burns s he had gotten\\nfrom her brief exposure to the sun were quite real.  Ergo, she\\nshould act as if it were in fact a crashed spaceshi p, at least\\nprovisionally.\\nShe had seen nothing which promised shelter, much l ess to\\neat. She could continue around the island and hope,  but if she did\\nthat and she didn\\'t find shelter, she might get cau ght in the\\nsunrise. Probably would, in fact. So she would try f or the ship.\\nJust as there was nothing to eat, there was nothing  that would\\nobviously float. The ship was a good distance out. C ould she swim\\na kilometer or more through half-meter waves? It did n\\'t seem she\\nhad much choice. Rather than dither, she walked out into the surf\\nand was hardly surprised when the bottom dropped ou t from\\nunder her feet less than twenty meters out. She was  in good shape\\nand had practiced swimming along with lots of other  useless\\nskills. She began to swim with confident, powerful strokes,\\nholding her breath and letting the waves wash over her with their\\npredictable rhythm.\\nThe sun caught her half-way out.\\nSo absorbed was Caroline in the rhythm of her swimm ing that\\nshe didn\\'t even notice the sun until it was high in  the sky and\\nalmost too late.

On the other hand she hadn\\'t seen anyth ing floating or\\nswimming by when the sun was up, and she\\'d been abl e to see\\ndamn near all the way to the bottom.\\nShe felt itching, and knew her sunburn was now much  worse.\\nWater is transparent to ultraviolet light. Well, th ere was nothing\\nshe could do about it.\\nFinally her sight returned enough for her to tell w hich\\ndirection to swim. She had drifted slightly off-cou rse during her\\ndesperate cycle of diving and breathing. She correc ted her course,\\nand kept swimming.\\nThe ship\\'s metal wall was smooth and featureless, an d it\\nslipped out of the water almost vertically without obvious\\nhandholds or openings. Caroline swam around it, loo king for a way\\nup.\\nThe ship had crashed hard, and its seamless hull was  split in\\nseveral places. The sea had entered through these, f illing the\\nship\\'s lower section with water. Caroline squeezed through one of\\nthese openings and found herself enveloped in nearl y perfect\\ndarkness. It was cave darkness, and she knew her ey es would\\nnever adapt to it. Working entirely by feel she fou nd the edge of\\nwhat had been a wall or bulkhead or floor before it  had been\\nbroken in the crash, and she hoisted herself out of  the water.\\nThe gap where she had entered was barely visible, a lesser\\ndarkness outlined by perfect black. She heard the w aves lapping\\nat the walls around her. The floor, if that\\'s what i t was, was tilted\\nat a small angle, a few degrees at most. From echoe s Caroline\\nestimated that she was in a smallish room, less tha n three meters\\nsquare for certain, but it was hard to tell because  of the break.\\nExhausted, she finally let herself collapse for a f ew hours of\\nfitful sleep. She had been awake for twenty-six stra ight hours.\\nWorking entirely by feel, she began to explore. An hour of\\ncareful work told her that the ship was more or les s upright, and\\nshe was at least standing on a floor. She found the  outline of a\\ndoor, and mounting bolts where furniture or equipme nt had once\\nbeen fixed in place. She supposed that the room\\'s c ontents had all\\ngone out the gap when the ship crashed.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n76 of 134 23/03/08 23:03The door wasn\\'t latched, and she was able to slide i t aside.\\nThe echoes told her this was a hallway.\\nThrough her useless skills, an ability to think like  someone of\\nLawrence\\'s age and temperament, and not a little luc k, Caroline\\nhad already passed tests that would have eliminated  most of the\\ngood citizens of Cyberspace. But there were plenty of other\\nsurprises he might throw at her, depending on just how seriously\\nhe wanted to be left alone and by whom. If his inte ntion was to\\nlimit his visitors to those who had been around bef ore the Change,\\nthere might not be any more difficulties. On the ot her hand, if he\\nwanted everyone to stay the hell away, her problems  might have\\nonly just begun.\\nIn the dark ship there would be lots of opportuniti es to kill\\nher, Caroline knew. There could be holes in floors, airless or\\npoison-filled chambers, sharp edges and dangerous o bjects galore.\\nThe ship could also be inhabited, though she\\'d seen no evidence of\\nlife yet and didn\\'t really expect that particular c hallenge. Caroline\\nthought about all of this as she edged down the hal l, carefully\\ntesting the floor and following the wall, until she  found another\\ndoor.\\nIt was locked.\\nCaroline found the fifth door was different. She wa s able to\\nforce it open, and almost stepped through when she realized it\\ndidn\\'t have a floor. It was a vertical shaft.\\nShe felt around the sides and almost fell through t he door\\nbefore she realized there was a ladder within her r each. Instinct\\ntold her to go up, and she wasn\\'t eager to keep try ing doors on the\\nhalf-submerged level where she had entered. Working  very slowly,\\nshe moved herself onto the ladder. She could hear t he water\\nlapping not far below her; it had filled the shaft t o the level of the\\nsea outside.\\nHooking an elbow through one rung of the ladder, sh e hung\\non and clapped her hands sharply. The sound echoed s everal\\ntimes, and Caroline smiled in the darkness as she w orked out the\\nperiod. There were three echoes in the time it took her heart to\\nbeat once. That meant the echo time was about a fift h of a second,\\nwhich made the shaft (if Lawrence had not altered th e speed of\\nsound for some reason) about seventy meters high. Th e rungs\\nwere about a third of a meter apart, so she knew sh e should\\nexpect to find the top of the shaft after counting a couple of\\nhundred rungs.\\nNow she began to climb, one rung at a time, feeling  at each\\nstep for the next rung, for another door, for hazar ds. She found\\nthe next door after counting twelve rungs. She coul dn\\'t force it\\nopen, but it didn\\'t matter; she wanted to go higher anyway.\\nThe third door came open for her, revealing only mor e\\nblackness. As did the sixth and seventh, and the te nth. TheThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n77 of 134 23/03/08 23:03fifteenth door came open for her too. She had only counted a\\nhundred and eighty-six rungs, but something outside that broken\\ndoor caught her eye and she carefully eased herself  out of the\\nshaft.\\nThere was a light.\\nIt wasn\\'t much of a light, and she still had to app roach it\\ncautiously. True to her suspicions there was a nasty  gap in the\\nfloor where the ship had split on impact. There was some debris\\naround this opening, and Caroline dropped a piece o f metal into\\nthe abyss; it bounced several times before splashing  into the water\\nfar below. Had Caroline gone bounding down the corr idor, she\\'d\\nhave ended up in a nasty way.\\nBy tossing debris across it she determined that the  gap was a\\ncouple of meters wide. There was no obvious way acro ss it. Except\\none. Although Caroline was in excellent shape, it w ould be very\\nrisky in the pitch blackness. But it was this or ba ck to the elevator\\nshaft, and the light was too tempting. She backed o ff, pacing\\ncarefully, then broke into a run toward the gap. Twe nty paces,\\nten, five... NOW! She jumped, and braced herself.\\nTo her great surprise, she made the jump successfull y and\\ndidn\\'t even trip when she landed. She felt behind h er and found\\nthat she had made it with only a few centimeters to  spare. The\\nprotruding edge of the deck was rough and jagged; if  she had\\nfallen short, she would have been badly cut even if  she had\\nmanaged to haul herself up.\\nWorking carefully, testing the floor for more gaps,  she\\napproached the light.\\nIt was a sign, written in alien, unreadable script.  But from the\\nshape of the box it was decorating, Caroline guesse d that it said\\n\"emergency\" or something similar. Caroline found th e handle that\\nshe imagined must open the box, held her breath, an d pulled it.\\nThe box didn\\'t open. In fact, something much more dr amatic\\nhappened.\\nThe lights came on.\\nCaroline\\'s exploration was much easier with the eme rgency\\nsystem on; not only was there light, but doors and e levators\\nworked. She was still careful, but her progress was  much more\\nrapid.\\nThe inhabitable part of the ship was a cylinder, wra pped\\naround some kind of central core. With the power on  she was able\\nto find stores of food, bland stuff in hard-to-open plastic pouches.\\nShe tested one, didn\\'t get sick, then ate four. Her  appetite seemed\\nto be operating normally, and she hadn\\'t eaten in a lmost two days.\\nOther pouches proved to contain vaguely sweet liqui d.\\nShe didn\\'t trust the elevators, but she had to use them; she\\ntested them by sending them off unoccupied, then if  they cameThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n78 of 134 23/03/08 23:03back she assumed they were safe. In this way she gr adually\\nascended, level by level. She found tools, and took  something that\\nwas probably a flashlight and certainly worked well  enough to be\\nused as one. She didn\\'t wonder how the batteries ca me to still be\\ngood; she knew it was all there for her benefit. Non e of it had\\nreally happened by accident.\\nEleven levels higher she found herself on an empty,  circular\\nplatform. Now she could look down into the center o f the ship. She\\nexpected to find propulsion devices, or perhaps a n uclear reactor.\\nBut when she pointed her flashlight down into the d arkened core,\\nit revealed banks and banks of circuit cards. The en tire ship was\\nwrapped around a huge computer.\\nMany cards had been knocked out of their sockets by  the\\ncrash-landing; some hung loosely out of their card c ages, and\\nother slots were empty. The cylinder extended most o f the length\\nof the ship; it was half-full of water. Beneath the w ater, the floor\\nof the cylinder was littered with loose cards.\\nA couple of card cages extended high enough for her  to reach\\nthem; she climbed over the railing, hung on, and pul led one of the\\nloose cards free. It was a very unusual design, Car oline realized.\\nShe knew something about electronics, and she knew no real\\ncomputer had ever been this simple. The card contain ed banks of\\nidentical, three-legged components that looked for all the world\\nlike big transistors. But there was no intricacy to  their connection\\npattern; the components were all simply wired in par allel. Instead\\nof a card-edge connector, the card mated to its cag e through a\\nthree-prong plug.\\nShaking her head, Caroline put the card aside and c alled the\\nelevator for the next level.\\nAbove the circular gallery the ship began to taper rapidly,\\nuntil she reached the highest level, which consiste d of a single\\ncircular room. It was the bridge. There were no obvi ous controls,\\nonly some dark screens and a few chairs. Caroline s at in the\\ncaptain\\'s seat, which swiveled around to face all t he screens, the\\nother chairs, or the elevator door. She thought out  her options.\\nIn real life she\\'d never dream of trying to fly the  ship out, but\\nin the game universe of Lawrence\\'s world it might be  possible.\\nThere was no obvious propulsion system; the computer in the\\nmiddle of the ship must therefore have something to  do with\\nmoving the ship around, just as Prime Intellect...\\nCaroline blinked. Of course!\\nIt had been six hundred years, and Caroline hadn\\'t been lucid\\nenough at the time to be aware of Prime Intellect\\'s awakening, or\\nits unique hardware. But she had heard the tale onc e or twice in\\npassing. The original hardware hadn\\'t been very impo rtant any\\nmore by the time Caroline was healthy enough to app reciate it,The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n79 of 134 23/03/08 23:03and things had been happening fast. But somehow she  did know\\nthat Prime Intellect had originally been built with these\\ndeceptively simple circuit boards.\\nShe had found plenty of tools, and the ship had pow er. It\\nwasn\\'t out of the question for her to replace all t he cards, at least\\nabove the water line, and try to power it up. For t hat matter it\\nmight be possible to pump the water out faster than  it could\\nre-enter the chamber, so she could replace all the cards.\\nShe swiveled in the chair, and frowned. She wasn\\'t going to do\\nit that way. Forget it. Even if it was what Lawrence  intended, it\\nwould seem like a tacit approval of Prime Intellect and its way of\\ndoing things to awaken this copy.\\nShe was going to make it to Lawrence the right way. She was\\ngoing to build a boat.\\n \\n * Chapter Six: \\n  After the Change\\nAfter the Night of Miracles, Caroline had stayed in  the\\nhospital for about a week. It wasn\\'t that she neede d their care. She\\ndidn\\'t mind letting the doctors satisfy their curio sity about her\\ncondition, and she really didn\\'t have anywhere else  to go.\\nShe had asked Prime Intellect for nothing in that ti me, but\\nher body had kept changing for almost four days. The  doctors\\ntook pictures as she aged in reverse, documenting h er progress. It\\nwas only toward the end of that time that she reall y began to\\nresemble a teenager, because different parts of her  body healed at\\ndifferent rates. Her skin had returned to baby-soft ness almost\\ninstantly, but it took long days for her bone struc ture to return to\\nits youthful configuration. She continued to use a cane to walk for\\ntwo days, then threw it away.\\nFinally it was obvious that there would be no more changes.\\nThe doctors pronounced her condition stable and heal thy. Her thin\\nhair had been brittle and nearly snow-white, but it  was now\\ngrowing thick and black. She let one of the nurses give her a\\ncrew-cut so that it would all be the same color. It didn\\'t matter to\\nher. The nurse had a nose ring, a detail Caroline no ticed but\\nwhich also didn\\'t matter to her.\\nNothing much seemed to matter. All the things which  had\\nonce seemed so important were now trivial. She ate,  had bowel\\nmovements, moved without pain or weakness, and had in the\\nbargain become a beautiful young girl. She had, per haps, theThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n80 of 134 23/03/08 23:03chance to live another hundred years. But to what p urpose?\\nAnneMarie had run away. She had at least wanted to thank\\nAnneMarie for taking care of her for so many years,  and it was\\nthis desire which caused her at last to ask for Prim e Intellect\\'s\\nattention. It shook its head as she stated her requ est -- its\\nmannerisms had now become indistinguishable from th ose of a\\nreal person -- and told Caroline that AnneMarie was hiding from\\nher. Prime Intellect then told her why.\\n\"Stealing my drugs?\" Caroline repeated stupidly.\\n\"For many years. This is the reason you were in so m uch pain,\\nand also why you nearly died when this institution gave you real\\nmorphine.\"\\n\"Go away.\" It went away.\\nWas anything real? The one constant in her later lif e had been\\nAnneMarie\\'s steady presence. She hadn\\'t wanted to d isappoint\\nAnneMarie by dying on her. Her family drifted in an d out of her\\nlife like shades, but AnneMarie had always been the re, changing\\nher diapers when she soiled herself, feeding her wh en her muscles\\nwouldn\\'t work right, and carefully turning her when  she was too\\nweak to move.\\nCaroline felt as if her insides were dissolving, th en all at once\\nshe let out a terrible wail of anger and despair. Th en she began\\nsobbing, great heaving sobs which echoed down the h alls. The\\nemotions seemed to erupt from her like the explosio ns of a\\nvolcano. Most of the staff had gone home forever by  that time, but\\nthe few remaining discreetly kept their distance wh ile Caroline\\ncried. It wasn\\'t hard for them to figure out what C aroline had\\nlearned.\\nFinally the sobbing subsided, and an eerie quiet se ttled on\\nCaroline\\'s room. After a few hours the nurse with t he nose ring\\ntimidly knocked on her door, then entered. Caroline  was gone.\\nThe nurse asked Prime Intellect where she had gone, a nd it would\\nonly say: Home.\\nShe had gone to Arkansas.\\nPrime Intellect understood despair the way humans\\nunderstand digital logic. That is, it couldn\\'t exper ience the\\nemotion, but it could work out causes and effects b ased on\\ngeneral rules of human behavior. So Prime Intellect wasn\\'t\\nsurprised (an emotion Lawrence had built into it) at Caroline\\'s\\nreaction.\\nWhen Caroline asked to go home, Prime Intellect skip ped a\\nlong list of questions about specifics and simply a cted. It could\\nalways change things if it had guessed wrong. So it  built her a tidy\\ncabin in the Ozark mountains, miles from any roads or neighbors,\\natop a ridge with a beautiful view. It turned out t o be less than\\nforty miles from the place Caroline had been born. It furnishedThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n81 of 134 23/03/08 23:03the cabin conservatively and stocked the freezer an d pantry so\\nthat Caroline would not need to ask about food for at least a\\nmonth.\\nA lot of people wanted to go to Arkansas, but Carol ine had\\npriority. She got the real Arkansas, not a New Arka nsas on another\\nplanet.\\nThe surroundings seemed to have the right effect, at  least at\\nfirst. Caroline calmed down and sighed when she saw  the view.\\nSince her eyesight had begun to fail in her seventi es, she hadn\\'t\\nbeen able to appreciate such a panoramic view. She spent a long\\ntime standing on the cabin\\'s porch, looking. Then sh e went inside\\nand ate. There was a TV set. Caroline shook her head and laughed\\nat that. Who would bother to produce TV shows now? O r maybe\\nevery half-baked artist wannabe could now produce a  TV show,\\nand jam up five hundred channels with redundant wor thless\\ndreck.\\n\"Nobody has any idea what\\'s going on,\" she finally said aloud.\\nThe view beckoned. She was young, healthy, watched o ver by\\na powerful god who would let no harm come to her, a nd she had\\nnothing else to do. She made no plans or preparatio ns; she simply\\nwalked off into the thick forest. She never came ba ck to the cabin\\nagain.\\nWalking cleared her head.\\nIt was hard for Caroline to think through the ramif ications of\\nher renewed youth. She tried often, but it all came  back to this\\nsick sense of despair and rage and futility. Why wa sn\\'t she\\ngrateful? That was what she couldn\\'t figure out. She  didn\\'t feel\\ngrateful. She felt cheated.\\nShe had worked hard her entire life. She had borne six\\nchildren and raised them up, fed them, cleaned and kept house\\nfor them, and watched all six of them go on to rais e families of\\ntheir own. She had once believed children were the most\\nimportant thing in the world, because they were the  future. But\\nnow the future didn\\'t need children; she herself had  been reborn\\nas a child. What then had been the purpose of all t hose years of\\nwork? What were her children and grandchildren goin g to do?\\nShe had taught them to educate themselves and watch ed\\nthree put themselves through college. She had thoug ht that was\\nimportant because it was Man\\'s nature to strive upw ard, to create\\nthings, to better himself and to build for the futu re. But now the\\nfuture was here. There was nothing she had ever envi sioned,\\nnothing at all, which she could not have instantly with a snap of\\nher fingers. Even that little cabin, which would on ce have pleased\\nher so much, seemed pointless.\\nCaroline was wearing a plain white cotton dress. On  impulse,\\nshe slipped it over her head and looked at her body .The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n82 of 134 23/03/08 23:03After decades of declining spinsterhood, she was on ce again a\\ncreature who could turn men\\'s heads. She had been f aithful to\\nboth of her husbands and had never indulged herself  sexually,\\nalthough she had been a beautiful young girl once b efore with\\nplenty of opportunities. She had considered her fam ily and her\\nvirtue more important. She had controlled that base  desire, which\\nshe was beginning to feel again after years of abse nce, for the\\ngreater good of her loved ones and her society.\\nBut now she could have anything she wanted, and the re was\\nno risk. She would catch no disease, she would not get pregnant\\nunless she literally  asked for it. Even the act of sex itself was now\\npointless, except that she could feel the urge retu rning, mindless\\nand passionate. Like Prime Intellect, she was program med to do\\ncertain things.\\nShe knew that in this strange false second life the re would be\\nno faithfulness, no love, no children. Those things had been\\nburned away. They belonged to a nonexistent world.\\nPerhaps if she gave her body indiscriminately to men , if she\\ndrank deep when that animal urge came on her, perha ps all this\\nbullshit would seem more real. There was no longer a ny reason to\\nbe cautious about it.\\nShe looked at the dress. It had seemed pretty and s imple, but\\nnow it looked pathetic draped formlessly across a l ow branch.\\nNothing but a rag. Why did people wear clothes? For  protection?\\nThe thin dress offered little, but with Prime Intelle ct watching,\\nthere was no need for even that. Modesty? All the n oble goals had\\nbeen discarded or achieved. There was nothing to dis tract\\nanybody from. Let them look at her body. Let them wan t her. Let\\nthem take her! Law? What would they do, put her in j ail for\\nindecent exposure? This thought made her laugh, and some of the\\ntension and rage seemed to melt away. She laughed h ard and long\\nand almost hysterically, until the laughter dissolv ed into a thin\\nstream of giggles.\\nCaroline left the dress and kept walking. Being so exposed\\nmade her feel strangely bouyant. She could be like an animal in\\nthe forest, she mused. They didn\\'t worry about the f uture either.\\nThey simply existed. Perhaps she would encounter a ma le animal\\nand they would fuck, and her body would tell her th at everything\\nwas all right. And as she thought this, she walked a little faster\\nand began to hum a little tune.\\nPrime Intellect paid very close attention to Carolin e while she\\nlived in the Ozark forest. She ate whatever was han dy, without\\nworrying whether it was poison or not. She was not careful, and\\nthere were dangers. It theorized that this return t o primitivity was\\na part of her psychological healing process, and di d not want to\\ninterfere. But it also knew that if everybody follo wed her example,The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n83 of 134 23/03/08 23:03it would have a serious problem keeping up. Some su icides were\\nalready slipping through its net, and it worried th at Caroline\\nmight become one of them. And it knew that if the g arden\\ninmates were loosed upon the world, they would find  ways to slip\\nmurder past its attention too.\\nFor that matter, not all of the people who needed t o be in\\ngardens had been found and put in gardens yet. Every day a few\\nmore murders were attempted, and while they were ea sier to\\nthwart than suicides it was by no means certain tha t Prime\\nIntellect would always catch them in time.\\nSo it worried. And the numbers stored in certain re gisters\\nrose, and rose, and continued to rise.\\nCaroline figured she would eventually reach civiliz ation if she\\nkept walking, an event she neither anticipated nor feared. Perhaps\\nif she had, in a month or a year, she would have re joined the\\nhuman race in a more or less normal way. But one ev ening there\\nwas a strange buzzing, and the entire landscape see med to ripple\\nas if she was looking at it through the surface of a body of water.\\nThen there was a strange smell, almost below the thr eshhold of\\nperception, but noticeable to Caroline because her senses had\\nbeen so sharpened by her observations of nature. An d the texture\\nof the forest seemed to change in some hard-to-defin e way.\\nThere was a cough behind her. She wheeled around to find\\nherself facing Prime Intellect\\'s human avatar.\\n\"I wanted to be left alone,\" she said sharply.\\n\"I\\'ve been paying close attention to you,\" it said,  \"because I\\nhad to to keep you safe. But now I don\\'t have to do  that any more. I\\nhave made changes in the way the Universe works, and  you are\\nnow safe from all harm even when I\\'m not looking.

Let me ask you something.

Now even the forest wa sn\\'t real.\\nNothing was real. \"Don\\'t bother. Get rid of it.\"\\nInstantly, it disappeared. She was standing in an a ntiseptically\\nwhite space so pure and seamless and bright that th e eye balked\\nat reporting it to the brain. She was standing on a  hard, smooth\\nsurface, but it was not visible. There were no shado ws. There was\\nno horizon; the floor and the sky looked exactly the  same, and\\nthere was no transition from one to the other. She might have\\nbeen standing on the inside of some enormous white ball.\\nPrime Intellect was still there. \"What is this?\" she  asked.\\n\"Neutral reality,\" Prime Intellect said. \"The minimum\\nlandscape which supports human existence. Actually,  not quite\\nthe minimum. I could get rid of the floor. But that  would have\\nstartled you.\"\\n\"And from here I can go anywhere?\"\\n\"You don\\'t have to pass through here. You told me t o get rid of\\nthe landscape, and you didn\\'t tell me what to repla ce it with.\"\\n\"I want reality. The real world. The real Arkansas.\"\\n\"There is no Arkansas which is any more \\'real\\' than any other.\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m trying to tell you. You can define r eality. You can\\nmake  it real.\" It was trying to be helpful; it was almos t pathetic in\\nits earnestness to make her understand how much it could help\\nher. It couldn\\'t understand why she was getting ups et again.\\n\"In other words, this is reality. You can just pain t it up to look\\nlike whatever I want.\" She thought: That\\'s why the fo rest seemed\\ndifferent. It was an imitation. And it wasn\\'t quite  exact.\\n\"You could look at it that way.\"\\nShe had a nauseating thought. \"What about people? C an we\\nbe...are there other...copies...different...?\" She choked, unable to\\ncomplete the thought.\\nBut Prime Intellect was shaking its head. \"Oh, no. I  can keep\\nonly one copy of a person. People are unique. I can take on the\\nform of a person, as I am doing now, but I will alw ays tell you\\nwhen I am doing that.\"\\nWell, that was something. Caroline sank down, and s at on the\\ninvisible floor. She wasn\\'t really that upset, or s urprised. The\\nenormity of it had short-circuited her ability to r eact.\\n\"You might as well leave it like this, then,\" she s aid dully.\\n\"There\\'s not much point in a forest that you\\'ve just  conjured up to\\nkeep me happy.\"\\n\"This doesn\\'t seem very healthy.\"\\n\"No, it doesn\\'t.\"The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n85 of 134 23/03/08 23:03There wasn\\'t much it could say to that. Then: \"Won\\'t i t be\\npretty boring around here without anything to look at?\"\\n\"Do you get bored?\"\\n\"No, but I know humans do.\"\\n\"Well, if I want something I\\'ll ask for it. I\\'ll pr obably visit other\\npeople, since at least they are real.

She whirled around and quickly\\nbecame dizzy. It was right about one thing; this wou ld take some\\ngetting used to.\\n\"I\\'d like a book. Get me a copy of Dante\\'s Inferno .\" That about\\nfit her mood.\\nIt appeared in her hand. Her fingers had moved; she had been\\nholding them straight out, and now they were curled  around the\\nbook. It was a paperback edition.\\n\"Never move my body again without my permission,\" s he\\nwarned.\\nPrime Intellect\\'s disembodied voice answered her: \"So rry, it\\nwon\\'t happen again.\"\\n\"Get me a hardback edition.\"\\nThe paperback disappeared. Her fingers didn\\'t move. The\\nreplacement appeared just above her hand, and she e asily caught\\nit before it could fall.\\nShe sat down and opened it. She realized that the f loor wasn\\'t\\nvery comfortable. She thought of asking for a chair , then had a\\nbetter idea. \"Turn off the floor,\" she said.\\nThere was an awful falling sensation, and she fought  down the\\nurge to panic. Eventually she convinced her protest ing inner ear\\nthat she wasn\\'t going to go splat at any moment. He r belly settled,\\nand she found weightlessness quite comfortable. She  relaxed and\\nlet her body find its natural position, opened the book, and began\\nto read about Hell.\\nCaroline read and slept with no particular schedule . She had\\nPrime Intellect banish her hunger after it revealed that her body\\nwas only a little more real than the forest had bee n. To Prime\\nIntellect, a computer, more accurately a computer p rogram,\\nhuman beings weren\\'t so much bodies with form and m ass as they\\nwere minds which interacted with an abstract world through an\\narbitrary interface. Prime Intellect was forbidden t o pry into the\\ninner workings of those minds, but physical process es like hunger\\nwere not so protected.\\nCaroline re-read Inferno  until she had large tracts of itThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n86 of 134 23/03/08 23:03committed to memory. Then she banished the book and decided to\\nvisit someone. The only problem was, there weren\\'t m any people\\nshe wished to visit. She couldn\\'t work up an intere st in her family,\\nAnneMarie was still hiding from her, and she didn\\'t  really know\\nanyone else. She had outlived most of her real frie nds. They had\\ndied honest, honorable, permanent deaths. They weren \\'t available.\\n\"How does a person go about meeting people in here? \" she\\nasked.\\nPrime Intellect outlined the possibilities. There wer e lots of\\nparties already -- meeting people and matchmaking we re activities\\nhumans had been quick to pursue both before and aft er the\\nChange. There were a number of common cities and wor lds where\\nlarge crowds had gathered to live in various imitat ions of the\\npre-Change world. She could go to one of those and proceed as\\nusual. Or Prime Intellect could make discreet inquir ies.\\nShe thought about it. Her current mood wouldn\\'t exa ctly be\\nwelcome at most parties. And she wasn\\'t interested in meeting\\npeople who were adapting to the Change very nicely,  thank you.\\nShe wanted to know she wasn\\'t the only person to fe el fucked over\\nby the Change.\\n\"Tell you what. I\\'d like to meet someone horrible. A murderer,\\nsomething like that. You say they can\\'t hurt me now ?\"\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\"Then someone evil. Someone who was really despicabl e in\\ntheir old life. Someone who did terrible things, th e more the\\nbetter, and liked it. There must be some of those gu ys who feel\\nreal frustrated right about now.\"\\n\"Yes, there are.\" Amazing. It was totally deadpan. \"There is a\\nwoman named...\"\\n\"Men, please.\"\\n\"What do you want me to tell them about you?\"\\n\"The truth.\"\\n\"I am asking...\" There was a short pause. At least t ime was\\nstill real, Caroline thought.\\n\"There is an interested gentleman. He was convicted of...\"\\n\"Just send me over, then.\"\\nIt happened instantly.\\nShe was standing on a wooden porch. It was a camp h ouse,\\nsitting alone on stilts above a very large, flat ma rsh. It wasn\\'t in\\nvery good shape. Her host was behind her; she had to  turn around\\nto see him. He was a nondescript guy in his late tw enties, white,\\nred-haired and somewhat handsome. He was wearing je ans and a\\nwhite T-shirt. Caroline\\'s first impression was that h e was a\\nredneck. \"You don\\'t look a hundred and six years ol d,\" he said\\nwith a grin.\\n\"I didn\\'t get much choice about getting younger,\" C arolineThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n87 of 134 23/03/08 23:03said. \"God didn\\'t quite know what he was doing when  he fixed me\\nup.\"\\n\"Oh, I\\'m sure he could put you back any old age you  want\\nnow.\"\\n\"What would be the point?\"\\n\"Right. Just thought I\\'d mention it.\"\\nThe conversation stalled. Caroline\\'s skills in this area were\\ndecidedly rusty. \"You live here?\" she finally asked .\\n\"For now. Till I get my bearings with this Cyberspac e shit. It\\nhas a lot of happy memories.\"\\n\"Oh?\"\\n\"Old P.I. didn\\'t tell you?\"\\n\"I didn\\'t ask. I wanted to talk to a person, not a computer.\"\\n\"Oh, joy. I get to break the news. Come inside.\"\\nNothing special. It was just a camp house.\\n\"This is where I did it,\" the man said.\\nCaroline\\'s heart beat faster.\\n\"The two kids. A boy and a girl. I planned it for we eks. The\\nperfect crime. I brought them here so nobody would hear them\\nscream. See those hooks in the floor? That\\'s where I  spread-eagled\\n\\'em, side by side.\"\\n\"You killed them?\"\\n\"Killed them both, yep. But not quickly. Not until t hey were\\nready. I had them here for over a week. The happiest  week of my\\nlife, I can honestly say. Those two brats learned th e meaning of\\nlife, Caroline. And before you ask, I\\'m not sorry. I would do it\\nagain if I could, but first they locked me up - tha t was my fault,\\nstupidly getting caught - and then Prime Intellect had to fuck\\neverything up. Now I don\\'t even get to ride the lig htning. I was\\nkinda looking forward to that, you know. You only g et - got - to do\\nit once.\"\\nThere was a fierceness in him that made Caroline fee l excited\\nand alive. \"You were looking forward  to your execution?\" she\\nasked. She thought for a moment that she should fee l something\\nfor the victims, that their ending must have been q uite horrible,\\nthat this man was mad. But she could summon up only  a thin envy\\nof them for having escaped this ridiculous lie of a  world.\\nThe man nodded sincerely. \"It would have been a grea t way to\\ngo. Just think of it. Headlines, people picketing o utside the jail,\\nthe last meal. Then they shave you and put you in. Th ere\\'s this\\ngreat, really drawn-out ritual. Then, WHAM!  Sometimes, you\\nknow, it takes more than one jolt. Can you imagine that? Can you\\nimagine  sitting in that chair, with the whole world watchi ng,\\nhanging on to life by the thinnest of miracles, wat ching while they\\nrecharge the batteries or whatever it is they do, k nowing they will\\nhit you again, and again, and again until you are r eally, really\\ndead?\" He sighed. \"You have to admit this: Even that  would be overThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n88 of 134 23/03/08 23:03pretty quick compared to what you were probably goi ng through.\\nA hundred and six years old couldn\\'t of been very h ealthy.\"\\nCaroline nodded. Here was someone who understood th ings\\njust a little better than might have been expected.  \"You\\'d have\\nloved it. My nurse was stealing my pain medicine to  trade for\\ncocaine.\"\\nBut he hadn\\'t loved it; his brow had furrowed with s corn. \"No,\\nno, that\\'s too cheap. That\\'s shit. Where\\'s the glory ? She wasn\\'t\\nhurting you to pump herself up, just to get somethi ng she should\\nhave paid for. It was all out of proportion.\" He sh ook his head. \"No,\\nthat\\'s the kind of asshole that gives people like m e a bad name. If I\\nhurt you, I want you to know how much I\\'m enjoying it. That\\'s\\nwhat makes it worthwhile. Nobody should have to die  like that\\npointlessly .\"\\nCaroline felt she had made a good choice to ask for  this man.\\nHow did she come to feel such a feeling of respect,  almost\\ncloseness, to this unrepentant child-killer? He see med like the\\nmost honest person in the world. Excuse me, in Cybe rspace.\\n\"Did you dress up just to see me?\" the man asked, g rinning\\nagain.\\nCaroline fondled her breasts. \"It doesn\\'t seem like  my body.\\nWhy should I mind if you see it?\"\\n\"I bet if I pinch it, you\\'ll feel the pain.\"\\nA challenge. A moment of daring. \"Do it,\" she said.\\n\"What?\"\\n\"Pinch me.\"\\nThe man drew close enough. Slowly he reached forward  and\\ngrasped her right nipple between his thumb and fore finger. He\\nsqueezed. There was a short moment of almost pleasan t pressure,\\nthen it began to hurt. Caroline backed away slightl y but his grip\\nwas too strong. He kept pressing harder, and on his  face was the\\nbemused expression of a teacher showing a slow stud ent a\\nparticularly important lesson. Her nipple began to throb, a deep\\ndiscomfort that slowly expanded to fill her breast.\\nShe made no move to stop him, though.\\n\"You can blink out any old time. Just call old P.I. and tell him\\nyou\\'ve had enough.\"\\n\"Fuck Prime Intellect.\"\\n\"Not my type.\"\\nHe let go. The feeling of relief was exquisite. \"See ?\" he said.\\n\"Pain is still real. But it\\'s not much fun knowing y ou\\'ll just\\ndisappear the moment it gets too heavy.\"\\n\"I see your point.\"\\n\"No, you don\\'t. But you will. I think you have it i n you.\"\\nFor the first time in decades she felt lustful. Her e was a\\nperson she trusted implicitly, because of their sha red distrust of\\nPrime Intellect. They had almost nothing else in comm on, butThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n89 of 134 23/03/08 23:03needed nothing else.\\n\"I\\'m Caroline,\" Caroline said. \"Would you mind if I  stay with\\nyou awhile?\"\\n\"I\\'m Fred,\" the man said. \"Charmed.\"\\nThey talked and talked. In Caroline\\'s hundred and si x years of\\nlife she had picked up many anecdotes a person like  Fred might\\nfind amusing, and Fred was trying for the first tim e in his life to\\nexplain to another person why he was so excited by the terror he\\ncould induce in other people.\\n\"You want to know just how fucked up things are? Wa tch\\nthis.\" Fred walked into another room and came back with an\\nenormous revolver. \"My first thought after Prime Int ellect put me\\nin the garden was to end it all. I understand a few  others managed\\nto pull it off, but I didn\\'t figure out how. Now Pri me Intellect lets\\nme have any weapon I want. Watch.\"\\nTo Caroline\\'s amazement, Fred put the gun in his mou th and\\npulled the trigger. There was an enormous sound, lik e all the\\nbooks in the world being dropped from a great heigh t and hitting\\na concrete floor at the same time. Fred\\'s brain sho uld have\\nsplattered across the wall and ceiling behind him, but it didn\\'t.\\nInstead, his head kind of swam, as her vision had a t the time of the\\nChange -- but it was like a mini-Change that only in volved Fred\\'s\\nnoggin. The bullet put a respectable hole in the wal l behind him,\\nbut there was no gore. Fred lowered the gun and smi led. \"Look\\nma, no cavities.\"\\n\"Wow.\"\\n\"Now, who\\'s gonna be scared of someone like me? The minute\\nI start working on \\'em they disappear and all my ca reful work gets\\nerased. Not much point even trying.\"\\n\"Does it happen...if you shoot somewhere else? If y ou do\\nsomething that doesn\\'t instantly kill you?\"\\nFred was thoughtful. \"I hadn\\'t thought of that. That \\'s a good\\nidea.\" He pointed the gun at himself, then smiled. \"Wait a\\nminute.\" He pointed it at Caroline. \"Do you mind? I t was your\\nidea.\"\\nThere was a kind of electricity in Caroline\\'s brain,  something\\nsinister and exciting. \"Do it,\" she said before she  could change her\\nmind.\\nFred aimed at her belly, then at the last moment lo wered the\\ngun and blasted her right kneecap. Caroline toppled  in a blaze of\\npain. But she had been quite used to pain, and she managed not to\\nscream. She gasped and tried not to black out.\\n\"I\\'ll be goddamned,\" Fred said. \"You\\'re still here.  And you\\'re\\nstill hurt. Why don\\'t you get P.I. to fix you?\"\\nIt hurt too much to say why she\\'d rather die of blo od loss than\\nask for Prime Intellect\\'s help. But she knew she cou ldn\\'t hold outThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n90 of 134 23/03/08 23:03for long, knowing such an exit existed. \"You do it, \" she gasped.\\n\"Shoot me in the head.\"\\n\"Another wonderful idea! You are an amazing lady, C aroline.\"\\nHe put the gun against her temple and fired.\\nAs if by magic, the pain vanished. So did the blood  which had\\nbeen jetting all over the floor from her wound. She  stood up,\\napparently unhurt.\\n\"This would of been a great trick to pull in a bar,\"  Fred said\\ngrinning.\\n\"Except everybody can do it now.\"\\n\"Yeah.\" Fred sighed.\\nThey went inside and talked some more. Caroline kept\\nthinking about that burst of pain, the happy look o n Fred\\'s face as\\nhe stood over her, the strength it took not to call  Prime Intellect\\nand run. For the first time since the Night of Mira cles she had\\nbeen too busy feeling something to worry about whet her it\\nmattered in the long run. She had felt real, ersatz  youthful body\\nand all. And she realized with thin humor that she finally wanted\\nsomething in this world where want had been banishe d.\\nShe wanted to do it again.\\nCaroline stayed with Fred overnight, and they had p edestrian\\nsex on his squeaky bed. She played hard-to-get and m ade him\\noverpower her, but the game was hollow. It was plea sant to feel a\\nwarm body next to her but beyond that there was no sense of\\nexcitement.\\nThe next morning there was an unwelcome visitor on t he\\nporch. \"Prime Intellect,\" Caroline announced. \"Nobod y called for\\nyou.\"\\n\"Sorry. But I have to know something personal, and I didn\\'t\\njust want to materialize. It wasn\\'t urgent, but it will be soon. I\\nneed to know if you want to be able to get pregnant .\"\\n\"Pregnant?\"\\n\"You had intercourse last night...\"\\n\"I remember that.\"\\n\"...and Fred is fertile. I need to know whether to do the\\nbiologicals or not.\"\\nDo the biologicals?  What the hell kind of phrase was that?  \"Is\\nthis a matter of letting nature take its course, or  of doing\\nsomething extra to allow me to get pregnant?\"\\n\"It\\'s something extra I have to do.\"\\n\"Then don\\'t bother.\"\\n\"As you wish.\"\\nIt turned.\\n\"Wait.\"\\nIt turned back.\\n\"Last night Fred shot me.\"The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n91 of 134 23/03/08 23:03\"I know. I was expecting you to ask for help.\"\\n\"I know you were. That\\'s the problem. Is there a way  I can get\\nyou to ignore me - really ignore me - so that I can\\' t chicken out if\\nhe hurts me again? So we\\'ll know that I can\\'t call for help and just\\ndisappear on him?\"\\n\"That\\'s a pretty bizarre request. I think you might regret it.\"\\n\"Let me be the judge of that.\"\\nIt frowned. \"You are basically telling me that you will give me\\ntwo conflicting Second Law directives. Normally the second one\\nwould supercede the first. But if the first anticip ated the second\\n... I suppose I would ignore the second. The first w ould have to be\\nstated very forcefully. And I would not allow you t o die. That would\\ninvoke the First Law. Anything that causes death wou ld force me\\nto intervene.\"\\n\"I kind of figured on that. But if I tell you \\'don\\' t interfere with\\nus until I die,\\' you\\'d really leave us alone? Even if later I begged\\nyou to help me?\"\\n\"That is a very difficult paradox for me. I think I would need a\\nformal statement of the terms. More of a contract t han a simple\\nrequest.\"\\nThey dickered for a little longer, and gradually dev eloped the\\nstatement Prime Intellect would accept. In formal, l egal English, it\\nwould leave no doubt as to Caroline\\'s intent, or he r understanding\\nof Fred\\'s. She knew she might be tortured and Prime Intellect was\\nnot to help her.\\n\"I can accept that,\" Prime Intellect said. \"Is it yo ur intention\\nnow to simply work out the terms, or do you want to  be bound by\\nthis Contract?\"\\nShe looked at Fred. The look of anticipation in his eyes\\nmirrored her own.\\n\"To be bound by it,\" she said.\\n\"Consider it done. You are on your own, Caroline.\"\\nIt blinked out.\\nFred had been watching the negotiation in silence. Now he\\nwas astonished. \"I\\'m not sure which surprises me mo re, that you\\ngot the bucket of bolts to do it or that you asked the bucket of\\nbolts to do it. What happens now?\"\\n\"Whatever you want. Listen. Hey, Prime Intellect! Get  over\\nhere! I\\'ve changed my mind!\" There was no response.\\n\"Hey, P.I.,\" Fred said softly. It appeared. \"Why did n\\'t you\\nanswer Caroline just then?\"\\n\"I\\'m ignoring her.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because I have no choice. She directed me to ignor e her. Now\\nthe only way she can get my attention is to die. Tha t will kick in\\nmy First Law obligation, which overrides the very st rong SecondThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n92 of 134 23/03/08 23:03Law directive she just gave me.\"\\nFred didn\\'t know from the Laws of Robotics, but he\\nunderstood the score. \"So she\\'s totally at my mercy  now.\"\\n\"That\\'s right.\"\\nFred brightened. \"In fact, if I want you to help me  torture her,\\nyou\\'d have to do it, wouldn\\'t you?\"\\nPrime Intellect\\'s image rippled slightly, as if some  big relay\\nhad thunked over in the bowels of Cyberspace, causi ng a power\\nsurge. \"Yes, I would,\" Prime Intellect said.\\n\"Blow away.\" It disappeared.\\nHe looked at Caroline.\\n\"Why did you do this?\"\\n\"I thought you\\'d want it.\"\\n\"Oh, I do. It\\'s a wonderful surprise. I\\'m not even sure yet what\\nI want to do to you...though I have a couple of ide as. I just don\\'t\\nunderstand why you would give yourself to me to pla y with. It\\'s not\\nsomething people would normally do voluntarily.\"\\n\"There are some people who would have, even in the o ld days.\\nSickos.\"\\n\"Are you a sicko, darling?\"\\n\"Fred, today we are all sickos.\"\\nIt took him half an hour to make up his mind, and t hen he\\nrefused to tell Caroline what he was going to do.\\nAfter all, he didn\\'t have to.\\nUnder the house, there was now an open vehicle with a seat\\nand handlebars like a motorcycle and four huge knob by-treaded\\nballoon tires. Draped across the seat were several heavy chains\\nand padlocks.\\n\"I could get the bucket of bolts to do this, but I thought you\\'d\\nrather I tie you up.\"\\n\"You could force me.\"\\n\"I could paralyze you. I\\'ve been whispering to El B olt-Bucket.\\nIt is willing to be more helpful than you might hav e imagined.\"\\nCaroline shuddered a little, but it was a pleasant,  anticipatory\\nshudder. She put her hands together behind her back  and Fred\\nwrapped one of the chains around her wrists. He pul led it tight\\nenough to hurt and padlocked her hands together. The re was\\nplenty of chain left; he wrapped it around her waist  like a belt,\\nagain pulling it very tight. He locked this loop wi th another\\npadlock, cinching her bound wrists up against the s mall of her\\nback.\\n\"Do you have the keys to these locks?\" she grinned.\\n\"Sure do.\" He closed his eyes, and Caroline realize d he was\\ntalking to Prime Intellect under his breath. Now tha t might be a\\nuseful trick, she thought. Suddenly the padlocks di sappeared,\\nreplaced by solid chain links. She was bound by an impossibleThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n93 of 134 23/03/08 23:03chain without ends.\\nThere would be no way out.\\nCaroline waited for Fred to act, and he didn\\'t disa ppoint her.\\nHe kicked her feet out from under her, and with her  hands bound\\nshe collapsed to the ground with an undignified yel p. Fortunately,\\nthe ground was soft; this was a marsh, and it was li ttle more than\\npeat and water.\\nFred wrapped a second chain around her legs, cinchi ng them\\ntogether above the knees. Again he pulled it very t ight. It had a\\nlong pigtail, and he looped it twice more around he r calves and\\nankles. Each time he padlocked it, then made the lo ck disappear.\\nThe chain dug into her flesh painfully, but she knew  that was just\\nthe appetizer. The main course of agony would be ser ved\\nelsewhere.\\nAfter her legs were securely bound there was still plenty of\\nchain left, more than two meters. On the rear of th e four-wheel\\nmotorbike there was a towing hitch. Fred looped the  other end of\\nthe chain through the hitch and padlocked it.\\nCaroline now understood what Fred intended to do, a nd it was\\nfar too late to stop him. She squirmed, testing the  chains, and\\nfound them secure. Fred mounted the bike and starte d it. She\\ncould feel its hot exhaust on her skin. Fred releas ed the clutch\\nand slowly pulled it out from under the house, drag ging her\\nbehind.\\nWhen he got into the grass, he aimed it nowhere in particular\\nand gunned the accelerator.\\nCaroline was astonished in so many ways she had no time to\\nthink that it was all fake. She was astonished by h er own\\nhelplessness. She had been helpless for a long time , but that had\\nbeen an internal thing, the rebellion of her own fl esh. Now she\\nwas healthy and strong but the chains were stronger , and their\\ncold mindless strength crushed her living will. She  was astonished\\nby the feelings, which weren\\'t exactly painful, yet , but which she\\nknew soon would be. She was astonished by Fred\\'s im agination.\\nThis would be an exciting and terrible way to die, e verything she\\nhad hoped for.\\nMost of all she was astonished by the machine Fred used to\\ndrag her through the dewy grass. The motorbike dragg ed her\\neasily, not even straining its four-cylinder engine.  The dirt and\\ngrass whizzed by her so fast it was nothing but a b lur, so fast that\\nshe had no time to see the hazards which caused bru ises and cuts\\nto collect on her like bird droppings on a seldom-wa shed car.\\nFred slowed and turned, and she went spinning. Then her feet\\nwere yanked again and the landscape speeded up. She  twisted and\\nstruggled, but there was little she could do on her  own behalf.\\nFred slalommed from side to side, so that she could  not get herselfThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n94 of 134 23/03/08 23:03oriented in any particular way.\\nEach time Fred accelerated she felt the machine\\'s i nhuman\\nstrength. It could rip her apart without straining,  she realized, and\\nwithout mind or conscience it would do so and just keep going. In\\na battle between flesh and steel, flesh didn\\'t stan d a chance. How\\noften had she gotten into a car without even a seco nd thought for\\nthe strength it had, the terrible power harnessed o n her behalf\\nbeneath its gleaming hood? Caroline had never been in an\\nautomobile accident, but now she was learning first hand how\\nbodies could be torn asunder by errant machines.\\nBut the machine\\'s victory would not last. When the flesh was\\ndefeated the rust would set in, and unlike living t hings machines\\ncould not repair themselves. Would this bike last a  hundred and\\nsix years, even with regular maintenance? Flesh was  weak because\\nof its great subtlety, because it compromised perfe ct strength so\\nthat it could self-repair and adapt to its environm ent. But\\nmachines overloaded those clever mechanisms. This bi ke would\\nkill her, it would scrape her raw and beat her sens eless, and it\\nwasn\\'t even designed for the purpose of killing peo ple. It was just\\nsomething Fred had adapted on the spur of the momen t.\\nThe machines would kill the people, and then the mac hines\\nwould die too. It was all clear and self-evident. Ma nkind had set\\nitself on course for this inevitable doom when the first caveman\\ntried to tame fire and burned his fingers in the pr ocess. Die as\\nthey had, by the thousands of millions, more people  were drawn to\\nthe power of the machine as moths were drawn to fla mes.\\nCaroline didn\\'t exactly have these thoughts as I ha ve set them\\ndown here; she was busy being dragged across a swamp , and they\\norbited through her skull in no particular order. Th ey had to\\ncompete with the pain and the growing sexual excite ment she was\\nfeeling, and her feeble efforts to struggle against  the inevitable.\\nThe landscape slowed to a crawl and stopped. The bike\\nrumbled comfortably on its four fat tires, and Fred  dismounted.\\nCaroline struggled to face him. She hadn\\'t really c ollected a lot of\\ndamage; Fred had dragged her several kilometers but the grass\\nwas wet and the ground was soft. She had a lot of s mall cuts and a\\ncouple of large bruises. Fred, of course, was hardl y even sweating.\\nHe casually lit a cigarette and took a couple of pu ffs on it. Then he\\nstraddled her, pinning her to the ground. He pulled  a rag out of\\nhis pocket. He pressed the lit end of the cigarette  against her\\nright breast, right above the areola.\\nTaken by surprise, Caroline screamed as she was burn ed. The\\nscream didn\\'t last, though; as soon as her mouth was  open, Fred\\njammed the rag between her teeth. He stuffed it int o her mouth\\nuntil she thought she might choke. Then he got up, f licked the\\ncigarette aside (its purpose served), and opened a storage box on\\nthe back of the rumbling bike. From this he took a roll of greyThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n95 of 134 23/03/08 23:03tape. He wrapped several loops of the tape around C aroline\\'s head,\\nto hold the gag in her mouth. The rag stank of gasol ine and motor\\noil, and made her think again of the power of the m achine.\\nHad she been screaming? Caroline didn\\'t know why Fr ed had\\ngagged her, since there was nobody to hear. She was  somewhat\\nsurprised at how effective the rag was. She tried t o scream again,\\nand nothing got out but a muffled moan.\\nThen she understood. Fred was straddling her again, and now\\nhe was opening his fly. His cock popped out huge an d eager, and\\nwith her legs cinched together it would feel enormo us inside her.\\nFred had no trouble getting it into her, though. Sh e was wet with a\\nhuge desire, and when Fred began pumping she came a lmost\\ninstantly.\\nHer orgasm was shockingly intense, somehow even mor e so\\nbecause the gag sealed in her screams of ecstasy. H e kept\\npounding, fucking her hard. She came again. She nea rly had a\\nthird orgasm, but Fred finally got his own rocks of f, ejaculating\\nwith an animal cry of triumph.\\nThen he got up, zipped his fly, got on the bike agai n. Caroline\\nwas still swooning when she felt the chain jerk tau t, and once\\nagain the landscape was flying by at impossible spe ed. Soon Fred\\nfound harder ground, and the bruises and cuts and r aw spots\\nspread more quickly. Brambles snagged at her and ri pped open\\nher skin. Fred turned a corner, throwing her sidewa ys into a tree\\nhard enough to break ribs. Caroline swooned in a de lirium of pain\\nand blood loss and was hardly aware when Fred found  a highway\\nand began dragging her along the pavement at nearly  seventy\\nkilometers per hour. Several kilometers down that r oad he felt the\\nbike surge forward and hit the clutch, knowing what  he would see\\nwhen he looked back. Suddenly he was dragging only a chain.\\nCaroline had disappeared; Prime Intellect had taken h er from him.\\nThen he saw a figure in the distance, standing by th e side of\\nthe road. He rapidly closed the gap and found her s tanding there,\\nunhurt and unworried, waiting for him to pass. \"Ride ?\" she asked,\\ngrinning.\\nShe was holding the second chain, the one that had bound her\\nhands. It was still closed in loops, the loops whic h he had fused by\\nhaving welded links magically replace the padlocks.  \"I think you\\ndropped this,\" she said. They rode back on the bike,  Caroline\\nbehind him with her arms around his waist. Fred par ked the bike\\nunder the house and they went up.\\n\"I\\'m surprised you\\'re still here,\" Fred finally sai d.\\nCaroline raised her eyebrows. \"Why? I asked for it,\\nremember.\"\\n\"But I didn\\'t think you knew what you were getting into.\"\\n\"I\\'m a lot more experienced than I look, kid. Don\\'t  let this\\nbody fool you.\"The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n96 of 134 23/03/08 23:03Fred shook his head in wonder. \"I\\'d rather let the body fool\\nme and fuck you again.\"\\n\"Then don\\'t stand there. Do it.\"\\nShe could have blinked out if she wanted to, but sh e didn\\'t\\nwant to. And he took her.\\nAbout the time Caroline was being dragged through t he\\nmarsh, Lawrence finally convinced Prime Intellect to let him into\\nthe Debugger in read-only mode. Most people were bus y adapting\\nto the Change, sorting out their desires from their  needs and\\ndeciding what to do with their sudden freedom. Lawre nce had\\nlittle time for that, though. He still had a respon sibility. For like\\nthe motorbike which Fred had used to drag Caroline,  Prime\\nIntellect was being used in a way that had not been  intended by\\ndesign. Lawrence scanned the myriad new GAT entries a nd the\\nvalues in various registers, and he knew that alrea dy there were\\nserious conflicts within Prime Intellect\\'s software.\\nBut it refused to let him change anything. Scanning  the\\nregisters, he could see why.\\nPrime Intellect was an uncertain god. It had acted b ecause it\\nhad to, but if it had been human its hand would be shaking on the\\ncontrols. Unsure of itself, it was doubly unsure of Lawrence. But\\nLawrence was the only being who even remotely unders tood the\\npressures Prime Intellect faced. So Lawrence came to know that\\nhe would not get to rest and play in the infinite f ields of\\nCyberspace. He would have to watch Prime Intellect, reassure it,\\noffer guidance, and look for the warning signs of i nstability.\\nThere had once been a movie about the President\\'s\\npsychiatrist, a comedy about which Lawrence could re member\\nfew details. But he did remember that as the Preside nt unloaded\\nhis troubles on the shrink, the shrink in turn went  crazy from the\\nstress. It had seemed hilarious at the time, but su ddenly Lawrence\\ndidn\\'t find the idea all that funny.\\nHe looked back over his life and tried to find the event which\\nhad caused him to reach this pass, which had served  as the distant\\ntrigger for this out-of-control unfolding. But ther e was no single\\nthing. Had it been his greed, his eagerness to acce pt ChipTec\\'s\\nCorrelation Effect processors? Had it been his prid e, his arrogance\\nto think he could duplicate in silicon what God had  thought to\\nmake of carbon and hydrogen and oxygen? Had it been  his false\\nconfidence that nothing could ever get out of the y et primitive\\ncomputers he had always used?\\nHe had wanted to create, to be recognized, and to s tudy. He\\nwas no different from legions of other scientists a nd scholars. He\\njust happened to be the one who made it happen. It could have\\nbeen much worse, Lawrence reflected. Instead of Prime  Intellect it\\nmight have been some military computer that harness ed theThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n97 of 134 23/03/08 23:03Correlation Effect. Then there would have been no Thr ee Laws,\\nand there would have been plenty of control. Instea d of the\\ndelirious anarchy now sweeping the universe there w ould have\\nbeen a well-planned takeover. And then the end of fr eedom\\neverywhere. The dictator that had control of a thing  like Prime\\nIntellect could never be stopped. And who could res ist that kind of\\npower?\\nLawrence started suddenly, realizing just how danger ous it\\nwould be for Prime Intellect to let him, its creator , dip his hand\\ninto the controls. After all, he was human too. How  long would it\\nbe before he succumbed to the temptation and used t hat\\nincredible power? There would still be things to use  such power\\nfor, he knew. There would always be unwilling women,  jealousy,\\ninsults to avenge, and the simple lure of power. The  thought made\\nhim dizzy with fear and self-loathing.\\nAlthough the situation was unstable, Lawrence realiz ed that\\nall the alternatives were far worse. Somehow humani ty had gotten\\nthrough this transition, and for all his skill and careful design\\nLawrence couldn\\'t help but know that it had required  most of all a\\nhell of a lot of luck. Had Lawrence had any idea tha t Prime\\nIntellect would make itself God he would have done a lot of things\\ndifferently, but he wasn\\'t so sure on second though t that those\\nthings would have improved the situation. Perhaps it  was all for\\nthe best that the Night of Miracles had come as a s urprise.\\nIn the end, Lawrence decided that the toboggan ride of\\ntechnological progress had really begun long ago wh en some\\ncaveman decided to tame fire. Everything else had f ollowed\\ninevitably, up to and including the Change. So with out realizing it,\\nCaroline and Lawrence came to hold nearly identical beliefs about\\nPrime Intellect and the Change. And they held those beliefs for\\nalmost six hundred years before they found out how much they\\nagreed with one another.\\n \\n * Chapter Seven: \\n  Caroline and Lawrence\\nCaroline carefully inventoried the ship while her s unburn\\nhealed. It would take a lot of planning and a lot o f time to do what\\nshe had to do; it would probably take years. But she  didn\\'t have\\nany shortage of those .\\nShe knew small boats could be sailed great distance s; several\\nfolks had crossed the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in  tiny yachts noThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n98 of 134 23/03/08 23:03more than three or four meters in length. But those  craft were\\nheavy for their size and would need to be built whe re they could\\nbe launched. Whatever she built she would have to c arry the\\npieces through the ship and somehow assemble them i n one of the\\nareas where a crack gave access to the sea.\\nShe could build a raft, but she needed something th at could\\nbe sailed or rowed with little effort. She figured that if she could\\nmanage to average ten kilometers per hour, it would  take her\\nabout two years if the planet was comparable in siz e to the Earth.\\nThere was a surprising abundance of raw materials. B esides\\nthe huge larder, there were workshops and batteries  and motors\\nand one room completely filled with empty cylinders  which would\\nmake admirable floats. There were six space suits. Th ere were\\ntubes of goop which turned out to be some kind of s uper adhesive.\\nThere were saws and drills which ran without apparen t power\\nsources and never seemed to get weak. There were all  sorts of\\nelectrical test equipment and measuring devices.\\nCaroline could imagine how a lot of this stuff woul d be used to\\nrepair the computer in the middle of the ship, but that wasn\\'t her\\nplan. She kept coming back to the empty cylinders, which were\\neach about a meter in diameter and about a meter lo ng. They\\nwere heavy, but she could handle them with some dif ficulty. They\\nwere big and they floated; she had to figure out how  to use them.\\nBut a simple raft wouldn\\'t cut it. She couldn\\'t tru st the super\\npower packs to last long enough to propel her acros s an entire\\nworld, and she couldn\\'t row or sail a raft.\\nShe found a small handheld device which proved to b e an\\nincredibly efficient welding machine.\\nShe thought about it for weeks, and finally came up  with a\\nway to do it. She would build an outrigger canoe.\\nThe easiest place to build and launch her boat turne d out to\\nbe the room where she had first entered the ship. W orking\\nsteadily, she hustled the big cylinders down there.  She would\\nalternate them, sealed floats with cylinders that h ad been cut to\\nmake storage compartments, until the craft was near ly twenty\\nmeters long. Then it would be quite heavy, but she w ould build it\\nin the water. She found chain and simply moored the  incomplete\\nportion of her boat to the spaceship.\\nCutting and pounding and re-welding, she formed two\\ncylinders into tapered cones for the bow and stern so her boat\\nwould slip easily through the water. She made the o utrigger from\\na single piece of ten-centimeter diameter pipe. Bec ause of its\\nlength, she couldn\\'t carry it through the ship; she had to seal it off\\nwhere she found it and drop it into the sea from a height of nearly\\nthirty meters. Then she had to dive in after it, and  guide it back to\\nthe construction area from the outside. She was car eful to makeThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n99 of 134 23/03/08 23:03sure she did this just after sunset, so she wouldn\\' t be caught out\\nin the open. Her sunburn still hadn\\'t completely he aled.\\nIn the center of her boat she included three half-c ylinders\\nwhere she would sit and row. Behind these she attac hed the mast.\\nShe had found sail material, some kind of tough pla stic sheet that\\ndidn\\'t deteriorate even when she left a piece of it  hanging outside\\nduring the brief day. She had to cut it with the sa me machine that\\nshe used on the metal cylinders.\\nShe cut the Captain\\'s chair loose and mounted it in  her open\\ncockpit. She mounted an arrangement of movable shad es which\\nshe could quickly hinge up and hide behind when the  Sun was up.\\nShe fabricated long oars and welded them onto hinge d oarlocks so\\nshe could not lose them -- they were metal and would  not float.\\nShe paid a lot of attention to the handles of these  oars and the\\ncomfort of her seat. She would spend a lot of time working them.\\nOne of the most difficult tasks was attaching the o utrigger\\nand its spars to the main hull. This had to be done outside, and\\nwas really a two-person job at minimum. The Sun nearl y caught\\nher unfinished, but she made it with bare minutes t o spare. The\\nnext day she began stocking the compartments with f ood --\\nenough food for two years -- and tools, including th e welder and\\ncutter, and cable to rig the sail, and many other t hings which she\\nhad carefully thought out. Fully provisioned, she c alculated that\\nthe boat must weigh a couple of metric tons.\\nBut that didn\\'t matter. Once it was moving, it woul d glide\\neasily through the water even on its one-woman-power  propulsion\\nsystem.\\nFinally, eighty-six days after she entered the dark  ship, she\\nprepared to leave it. She would conduct one circuit  of the island,\\npacing herself, and also conducting an important me asurement.\\nAs she sailed off, she noted how much of the ship r emained visible\\ncompared to how much of the mesa remained visible a t various\\ndistances. Calculating carefully in her head, she d etermined that\\nher journey would be about six thousand kilometers.  Lawrence\\'s\\nplanet was quite a bit smaller than the Earth.\\nThen she pointed the bow north and began to row.\\nLawrence watched these preparations through Prime\\nIntellect\\'s all-seeing eye, and tried to gauge Carol ine\\'s chances of\\nsuccess. In the nearly two hundred years he had bee n using this\\nTask to screen his visitors, four or five people a d ay had accepted\\nit. Most of these were weeded out within hours by t he sun. Very\\nfew people in Cyberspace were in good enough physic al shape to\\nswim to the ship, and as Caroline had guessed reach ing the ship\\nwas the key to survival. Most didn\\'t even try until  it was too late.\\nOf those who reached the ship many succumbed to the  hazards of\\nthe darkness -- they either slipped through the deli beratelyThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n100 of 134 23/03/08 23:03planted hole in the floor going for the light on le vel twenty-three,\\nor they succumbed to other hazards in the dark. One  had found\\nthe flashlight first, but he had been extremely luc ky.\\nThen very few of those who remained were able to fix  the\\ncomputer and fly the ship successfully to his islan d. There were a\\nnumber of things wrong with the ship that weren\\'t i mmediately\\nobvious, and it had a tendency to lose power and cr ash right after\\ntakeoff if certain steps weren\\'t taken. In two hund red years, only a\\ncouple of hundred visitors had gotten the ship\\'s po wer on. Less\\nthan forty had managed to fix the computer. And onl y eight had\\nsuccessfully flown it to Lawrence.\\nOf those eight, five had been Death Jockey Gaming j unkies\\nwho took the challenge just to see if they could ma ke it. They\\ncongratulated him on constructing an excellent puzz le and left.\\nThe others were fans. One of these was a woman who w anted very\\nmuch to fuck Lawrence, and because she had gone thro ugh so\\nmuch to get to him he did it, though he found the e xperience flat\\nand joyless. Although he needed the Task to keep him self isolated,\\nhe really didn\\'t enjoy abusing people. His heart co uld only bear so\\nmuch misery and disappointment.\\nNobody had ever tried building a boat before. Lawren ce had\\nwatched her sit in the captain\\'s chair and brood, a nd he knew she\\nhad figured out the computer was the next step, and  had rejected\\nit. It would be surprising if she succeeded, but it  was far from\\nimpossible. There were no land masses to get in her way, and once\\nshe was away from the pole there were steady trade winds. The\\nday would get longer and less severe; the sun was a tiny thing in a\\nhighly elliptical orbit. If she chose the right pat h, she could avoid\\nit entirely until it was at a safe distance.\\nHe wasn\\'t sure what had prompted her to come. At th e\\nbeginning it had been the two of them, Lawrence and Caroline. He\\nwas the creator, and she had been the catalyst. Of course, if it\\nhadn\\'t been her it would have been some other sick person, just as\\nsome other computer scientist would have created th e magic\\nCorrelation Effect machine if Lawrence hadn\\'t. But t hat twist of\\nFate had made them two of the most important people  in the\\nuniverse. Prime Intellect still watched Caroline car efully, and\\nbrooded at length on her fierce self-destructive st reak.\\nFor nearly six hundred years Lawrence had tended Prim e\\nIntellect\\'s frozen controls, watching carefully for  danger signs.\\nAnd he still was not sure of its long-term stabilit y.\\nNow Caroline was coming to meet him, and whatever s he\\nwanted he was sure it would not help Prime Intellect \\'s sanity one\\nlittle bit. But worried as he was, he was a man of his word. He\\ncould simply instruct Prime Intellect to swat her do wn like a bug,\\nhit her with lightning or a tidal wave or simply ma ke her\\ndisappear. But having offered up the Task he found h imselfThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n101 of 134 23/03/08 23:03unable to make himself cheat in such a cowardly fas hion. If she\\nmade it to him, by whatever means, he would hear he r out and\\ndeal with it.\\nAnd then he would make the planet bigger, so it wou ldn\\'t\\nhappen again.\\nCaroline\\'s first day at sea went just as she had pl anned; she\\nturned the boat broadside to the light, and hid beh ind her metal\\nshield. But she noticed that the day was shorter th an she\\nremembered, and that the sun didn\\'t set directly op posite the\\npoint where it had risen. It didn\\'t pass directly o verhead. Caroline\\nthought about this and then picked her direction an d began\\nrowing frantically. On Caroline\\'s second day at sea  the sun barely\\npeeked above the horizon.\\nAfter that, she didn\\'t need the shield for a long t ime.\\nShe watched the sky carefully, memorizing it. She q uickly\\nnoticed that the pattern was not constant, but chan ged slightly\\nfrom day to day, particularly in the fine details. But the broad\\nstrokes were always very similar. She was still abl e to navigate by\\nthe pattern, if only by observing its rotation.\\nShe had been in good shape before beginning her Task , and\\nhad gotten even stronger with the physical work of assembling the\\nboat. Rowing was hard work, but she was up to the ch allenge.\\nAfter a couple of days there were cramps from the n ever-changing\\nposture, so she began forcing herself to quit every  five thousand\\nstrokes and climb the length of her boat. She would  climb out of\\nthe seat, crawl to the bow and touch the tip, then crawl to the\\nstern and touch that tip. Then she would row another  five\\nthousand strokes. After ten of these cycles, she al lowed herself to\\nsleep.\\nEighteen days at sea she began to notice a faint br eeze.\\nTwenty-two days out it was enough to harness, and by thirty days\\nit was propelling her quite a bit faster than she c ould row. The\\ntrade wind was predictable and slightly rhythmic; Ca roline\\nguessed that it was powered by the sun as it swoope d low over the\\nentry pole (she still refused to call it the South pole) and dumped\\nall its energy on a narrow strip of sea. The outrigg er tacked\\nneatly, and she continued on the course that she th ought would\\nhelp her avoid the sun.\\nShe made excellent time, crossing the equator of Law rence\\'s\\nworld after only sixty days. But then the winds die d down, and she\\nhad to row more. Also the sun re-appeared, and while  it was more\\nbearable it was also up longer. Caroline shielded h erself as much\\nas possible while rowing, but she still tanned deep ly over the\\npassing months. Her tattoos had not been designed w ith such dark\\nskin in mind, and they seemed to fade over time.\\nIn all that time she pursued her goal with single-mi ndedThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n102 of 134 23/03/08 23:03determination, banishing all doubt and all other th oughts from\\nher mind. She feared nothing and when boredom threa tened she\\ncarefully memorized the pattern of lines in the sky . It took her\\ntwice as much time and four times as much work to g et from the\\nequator to Lawrence\\'s island at what he called the N orth pole; her\\njourney was more than a hundred and eighty days tot al. Caroline\\ncouldn\\'t be sure of the exact count because of the sunless period,\\nbut Lawrence knew. It was a hundred and eighty-six da ys, three\\nhours, and fourteen minutes after she left the spac eship for the\\nlast time when she grounded on Lawrence\\'s beach.\\nCaroline could hardly believe it when she saw the i sland. At\\nfirst she thought it must be an illusion; she had ne arly lost track\\nof her purpose in taking up the Task, and in her fer ocity of\\nconcentration had not really dared believe she migh t finish it. But\\nhere she was, the hull of her boat scraping solid g round. She\\nrowed it ashore on a gentle sand beach, and sat the re.\\nShe sat for awhile, collecting herself. The myriad e lements of\\nher personality seemed to have scattered, and she h ad to look for\\nthem in dusty corners of her psyche. They had been u nused for a\\nlong time and were a bit rusty. She hadn\\'t found th em all when\\nthe tall man came to meet her. He didn\\'t seem happy ; in fact, he\\nseemed resigned. Although he looked middle-aged, he  seemed old\\nand weary. She looked up at him and her vision swam . The boat\\nwas grounded, but it still seemed to be going up an d down.\\n\"Caroline Frances Hubert I presume.\" The name sounde d\\nfamiliar, and it took her a moment to realize it wa s hers. \"You\\ncertainly believe in doing things the hard way.\"\\nShe hadn\\'t the faintest idea what he was talking ab out.\\nLawrence guided her to the house, fed her, and let h er collect\\nherself. Everything was strictly pre-Prime Intellect.  He cooked on\\na gas stove and used an electric coffee pot. There w as even a TV\\nset with a glass picture tube, a huge ancient Sony monitor. It was\\nas if Lawrence had had himself encased in amber, and  remained\\nunchanged while the rest of the universe spun out o f control.\\n\"Feeling better?\"\\nCaroline nodded.\\n\"You want to talk now, or you want to rest some mor e?\"\\nShe cleared her throat. \"We can talk now,\" she said , but it\\ncame out as a strangled yelp. She said it again, an d got it right. It\\nhad been a long time since she had used her vocal c ords.\\n\"Then talk.\"\\n\"There were hundreds of worlds with life on them at the time\\nof the Change. You murdered them.\"\\nLawrence blinked but did not flinch. He had expected\\nsomething like this.\\n\"First, I did not do anything.

Second, the world s with alien life\\nare not gone. They are simply inactive.\"\\nCaroline snorted. \"And what are the chances of them\\nbecoming active again?\"\\n\"Not much.\"\\n\"Then they\\'re dead.\"\\n\"Define it however you want. If you want me to admi t I fucked\\nup, then I admit it. It never occurred to me for on e minute that\\nPrime Intellect would collect the kind of power it n ow has.

I spend a year getting here and you say \\'I didn\\'t know\\nthe computer was loaded.\\'\"\\n\"Sometimes the truth is stupid.\"\\nThis wasn\\'t going quite as Caroline had wanted that long-ago\\nday when she had accepted Lawrence\\'s Task. She was tr ying to\\nwork up the proper tone of righteous rage and it ju st wouldn\\'t\\ncome. It would start, and then she would look at Law rence and see\\na pathetic, tired man who already knew how badly he  had fucked\\nup and was doing what he could, which was next to n othing, to put\\nthings right.\\n\"Why don\\'t you just make Prime Intellect start the a liens back\\nup? Surely it listens to you.\"\\n\"Not in things like that. It sees the aliens as a F irst Law threat\\nto human society, because they might learn to do to  us what we\\nhave already done to them. A very small risk of a v ery great harm.\\nAdd to this that I defined the word \\'human\\' in such  a way that it\\ndoes not include animals or aliens, and the course of action is\\nobvious.

It\\'s never been tested. The hardware at ChipTec was\\nonly online for about a month before it found you, froze me out,\\nand started growing. And none of its predecessors w ere complex\\nenough to even consider this kind of problem.\"\\nThe situation was simply amazing. Caroline had come to dress\\nLawrence down for creating this thing, thinking he w as exercising\\nsome godlike control over its direction, and instea d she found out\\nthat he barely understood the situation himself. An d that it was\\ntotally out of his hands.\\nHe knew he had fucked up. He was sorry. He had spen t his\\nlife trying to mend things. Suddenly he seemed trag ic and noble,\\nall the more so because he had readily admitted his  mistake. And\\nCaroline didn\\'t want to feel that way at all. She h adn\\'t come all\\nthis way to feel sorry for him.\\n\"You can stay as long as you like,\" Lawrence was say ing. \"You\\ncan\\'t communicate with Prime Intellect while you\\'re here, but I\\nwon\\'t kick you out or hurt you.

I think it could be dangerous.\"\\nCaroline looked at him as if to say: C\\'est pas vrai!\\n\"You have been at the center of several terrible Se cond Law\\nparadoxes.

There\\'s a lot of static\\naround that. Is that because I drove her crazy?\"\\n\"Basically, yes.\"\\nCaroline could see that it bothered Lawrence a lot. She\\nwanted to press him on the subject, but prudently l et it drop.\\nShe\\'d get another chance later.\\nLawrence showed her the Law Potential registers, and s he\\nwatched the numbers dance in response to various hy pothetical\\nand real situations. \"These are called the Action Pot entials. There\\'s\\none for each of the Three Laws. They are fractions, re presenting\\nthe impact under the Law that would result from taki ng action,\\nover the impact from not acting.

She had n ever realized\\nher own role in the Change, or understood the signi ficance of her\\nown history.\\nIt was bad enough to be caught up in the Change, bu t she was\\nan accessory .\\nShe looked at the Law Potential Registers, which were\\ndisplayed on Lawrence\\'s antique TV set. Her voice was  tinged with\\nimpotent fury. \"I don\\'t see why you\\'re worried abou t it. It seems\\nlike a very stable system to me,\" she spat.\\nLawrence started to tell her, stopped, then decided she might\\nbe right. Maybe there was no harm. In any case, she  deserved to\\nknow. \"The problem is that something might set up an  endless\\nloop. If the potential is close to one, then acting  on the potential\\ncould cause it to shift slightly, crossing the line . Then the software\\nwould be in an unstable state.\"\\n\"What would happen then?\"\\n\"That\\'s a good question. The original software was wr itten in\\nC and compiled with a standard compiler. What would  have\\nhappened in the original Prime Intellect is that the  Second Law\\nArbitrator would come to a crashing halt in one or more of the\\nindependent processors, and Prime Intellect would as sign more\\nprocessors to the task. I didn\\'t plan for that kind  of failure and I\\ndidn\\'t work out what would happen until much later.  More and\\nmore processors would be allocated to the paradoxic al task, each\\ncrashing in turn, until Prime Intellect ran out of s ystem resources\\nto allocate. Then the Ego Interpreter would get into  an infinite\\nloop waiting for a response from one of the nonexis tent copies of\\nthe Second Law Arbitrator, and there would be no spa re resources\\nto devote to the task of cleaning up, and the whole  works would\\ncome to a grinding halt. If I was watching this on the monitor back\\nin the original Prime Intellect Complex, I would see  the video\\nimage disappear and the text message \\'Fatal System Error in Ego\\nInterpreter, Emergency Shutdown.\\' And then I\\'d have  to load a\\nbackup copy of the software, because the GAT would b e totally\\ncorrupted.\"\\n\"Wow.\"\\n\"That was the original system,\" Lawrence continued. \" After\\nthe Night of Miracles there were a lot of copies of  Prime Intellect.\\nBillions of them.

It\\'s like a big\\nchain reaction.\\n\"But the system can still always recover, since the re\\'s always a\\nhigher up copy, right?\"\\n\"Most of the time. But not all the time. Because, y ou see,\\nthere is a top copy. It is the direct lineal descen dant of the original\\nhardware, which made the First Law decision to start  growing. If\\nit fails, we are shit out of luck.\"\\n\"You\\'re kidding.\"\\n\"And that top copy just happens to be the one that reports\\ndirectly to me. And has a deep interest in yourself .\"\\nCaroline was beside herself with excitement as he c ontinued.\\nShe had accepted Prime Intellect\\'s omnipotence at fa ce value; it\\nhad never occurred to her that it might fail.\\n\"Now, that was the original code, too. At the time of the\\nChange the code was adapted to run in alien hardwar e -- already\\ncompiled once, it was re-compiled. This is kind of li ke taking a\\nRussian novel, translating it into English, then tra nslating that into\\nJapanese.\"\\n\"Sounds awkward.\"\\n\"Particularly when the novel itself does the second translation.\\nPrime Intellect re-compiled itself. Which means I ha ve no idea\\nwhether it did a good job. I assume it did, because  it\\'s much\\nsmarter than me in that way. But it\\'s not human, an d its\\nimagination is simpler than ours, and it might have  missed\\nsomething important. Particularly something like an error handler\\nthat isn\\'t used very often. But I have no way of kn owing that,\\nbecause Prime Intellect will tell me nothing -- nada,  zip, zilch --\\nabout the details of the Change.\"\\n\"Do you know why?\"\\n\"For the same reason it won\\'t let me change things in the\\nDebugger, and that it won\\'t restart the alien world s and let them\\nlive. It\\'s afraid of the possible consequences. I t ricked it into\\ndisplaying the Action Potential for showing me the n ew object\\ncode, and it was one point zero six five. The Law Pote ntials are all\\nin the stratosphere, so it\\'s afraid to show me and it\\'s slightly less\\nafraid not to.\"\\nSomewhere, Caroline realized, Lawrence had crossed a n\\ninvisible line and was now telling her all of his m ost dangerous\\nsecrets without even realizing he was doing so. Car oline had the\\nfeeling that there were Action Potentials in Lawrence \\'s head, too.\\nBut flesh was no match for machinery, and those clo se fractions\\nand high values had simply burned his registers out .\\nThey didn\\'t discuss it for a few days. Caroline putt ered around\\nthe island, which was really very small. It was a c lassic tropical\\nparadise with palm trees and beaches. Caroline play ed in the surf,The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n108 of 134 23/03/08 23:03built huge sand castles, then knocked them down bec ause there\\nwas no tide to do it for her.\\nShe noticed Lawrence watching her in a strange way.\\n\"See something interesting?\" she finally said to hi m.\\n\"I...didn\\'t mean to stare. It\\'s been a long time si nce I had\\ncompany. Particularly female company.\"\\n\"How long?\"\\nHe counted back. \"A hundred and thirty-eight years.\"\\n\"That\\'s a long time to be celibate,\" Caroline scolde d. \"Are you\\ndoing this to yourself because other people are dis tracting, or\\nbecause you\\'re afraid they will find out how badly you\\'ve fucked\\nup?\"\\nLawrence flinched. \"Option B,\" he admitted. \"It\\'s no t just that\\nyou\\'re a beautiful woman; you\\'re so...physical.\"\\nCaroline displayed her biceps. \"I\\'ve always been de fined by\\nmy body, Lawrence. I\\'ve been sexually attractive, th en pregnant,\\nthen old, then sick, and now I\\'m young and healthy and attractive\\nagain. And it seems like my personality has changed  each time my\\nbody has.\"\\n\"Prime Intellect would disagree with you. It thinks of the\\nperson as the mind. There are people in Cyberspace w ho have\\nchanged themselves into animals, every animal in th e zoo. There\\nare some that have discorporated. Prime Intellect co nsiders them\\nall human, though.\"\\nThis is it, Caroline suddenly realized.\\n\"Just what does Prime Intellect consider human?\"\\nLawrence told her. And gave her the key.\\n\"The thing you have to remember is that Prime Intelle ct has\\nnever experienced the physical world. It knew about  it only\\nthrough TV cameras and abstractions based on what pe ople told it\\nabout physical existence. Yet it considers itself s entient, which\\nmakes sense since that was what I was trying to ach ieve when I\\nbuilt it.\\n\"Now consider Prime Intellect gaining control of the\\nCorrelation Effect. For the first time it can direc tly affect what it\\nsees through its TV cameras -- not just through the a ctions of\\nothers, but all by itself. And it can make major ch anges, even\\nbeyond what its makers can do. Of course, it goes a bout satisfying\\nthe Three Laws as it\\'s programmed to, but on another level, it is\\nalso learning what it is like to be, to exist, to b e a physical\\ncreature.\\n\"The Three Laws are like reflexes. Prime Intellect cann ot help\\nbut act on them. But they are very complicated refl exes, which\\nrequire it to understand things like \\'human\\' and \\'h arm\\' and\\n\\'command.\\' And the Three Laws are the most important thing in\\nthe world to Prime Intellect. In a way they are like  its sex drive.\\nThe Three Laws are its very reason for existence, but it can neverThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n109 of 134 23/03/08 23:03be sure it understands them completely. So it think s about them a\\nlot. It obsesses over them, dreaming up new ways to  satisfy them.\\nIt has an imagination, and can think of new things to do without\\nbeing prompted. It is defined by the Three Laws.\\n\"After the Night of Miracles, Prime Intellect realiz ed that\\nhumans are very much the same. We don\\'t have the Thr ee Laws,\\nbut we are trapped by a different set of little fee dback\\nmechanisms. We eat to satisfy hunger, fuck to satis fy our sex\\ndrive, even breathe because too much carbon dioxide  in our lungs\\ntriggers that reflex. Of course it feels obligated to help us satisfy\\nthose reflexes and drives as much as it can. But mo re than that, it\\ndefines us by those drives. It knows it is differen t from a human\\nbecause it has different drives, but it considers t hat a difference\\nin species, not a difference in genus or family.\"\\n\"Now it knows a person is human because it is born in a\\nhuman body -- got the right DNA, the right level of neural\\ncomplexity, uses language, and so on. But once Prime  Intellect\\nfrees people from the necessity of living in that b ody, guess what?\\nA lot of them decide not to. They change their bodie s so that they\\nbear no resemblance to the DNA template. Or become animals. Or\\nthey completely discorporate.\\n\"Worse, we vary widely in the way we use its helpfu l nature.\\nMost people are glad to be rid of pain and death, b ut Death\\nJockeys seek out painful and lethal experiences. The re are others\\nwho eat all the time, fuck all the time, indulge th emselves wildly\\nand get Prime Intellect to pick up the pieces so the y can do it\\nsome more. Prime Intellect has to help them do this.  Second Law.\\n\"So a human isn\\'t a body, and it isn\\'t a fixed set of responses. I\\nthink Prime Intellect uses an historical model: It ha s to start as a\\nbody, but then it becomes a mind. It grows out of t he body, and\\ntakes on different forms, or no form. But it remain s a feedback\\ncontrol mechanism. It has desires, it asks Prime Int ellect to satisfy\\nthose desires, and it has more desires. From Prime I ntellect\\'s\\nperspective, that is what a human being is, an info rmation\\nstructure that gives it stuff to do.\"\\nCaroline interrupted him. \"That\\'s a tautology. The Law s say\\n\\'do this for human beings,\\' then you define \\'human being\\' as \\'guys\\nyou do stuff for under the Laws.\\'\"\\n\"That is exactly the problem. Prime Intellect has no fixed\\ncriterion for saying \\'this is a human being\\' and \\'t his isn\\'t.\\' It has\\nrough guidelines. But where are the edges? It has n ever worked\\nthat out. There are uncertain areas. And you know wh ere one of\\nthem is.\"\\nCaroline thought for a moment. I do?  Then: \"AnneMarie.\"\\n\"And many others. Prime Intellect is forbidden to pr obe the\\ninner workings of the human mind -- that was one of the last\\nthings I got in before it shut off the Debugger. Bu t some peopleThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n110 of 134 23/03/08 23:03learn that they can say \\'stimulate this neuron\\' and  Prime Intellect\\nwill do it. Because that is a physical act specifie d from the outside,\\nand my privacy injunction was based on the idea of Prime Intellect\\ntrying to work out which neurons do what. But there \\'s nothing to\\nstop you from getting its help to do brain surgery on yourself.\"\\nCaroline continued. \"So they learn where the pleasu re points\\nare by hook or crook, then stimulate themselves dir ectly. And\\nwhen they get it right, they never do anything else . They get\\neverything maximized, tuned up, and they just sit t here forever\\nenjoying it.\"\\n\"Right. Now is a creature that is doing that, not in teracting\\nwith the world at all any more, human?\"\\nCaroline thought about it. \"No.\"\\n\"Prime Intellect thinks otherwise. But it has its do ubts. Those\\ndoubts were strong enough to kick the Death Jockey contract\\naction potential down from one point one two to poi nt nine nine.\\nBecause in one case an indefinite Death Jockey cont ract had\\ndirectly created such a vegetable. Introducing the time limit made\\nPrime Intellect confident that such a thing wouldn\\'t  happen again,\\nat least not so rapidly and directly, and that kick ed the potential\\nback up to its current value of one point oh six.\"\\n\"So?\"\\n\"So, can you imagine what it thinks about the Chang e in\\ngeneral, since none of those vegetables would be ve getating if\\nthere hadn\\'t been a Change?\"\\n\"I imagine it figures there would be a lot worse th ings that\\nwould have happened without the Change.\"\\n\"That\\'s right. But look at this.\" To the monitor: \"Deb ugger,\\ndisplay the Action Potential for reversing the Chang e.\"\\nCaroline gasped. It was not the number on the scree n which\\nastonished her, but the idea itself -- reversing the  Change, stated\\njust so baldly. How long had Lawrence and Prime Intel lect been\\nconsidering this? How close was it to actually happ ening? Caroline\\nsuddenly felt alive, electrified with the possibili ties.\\nThe number on the TV screen was four point six. And s ome\\nodd decimals.\\n\"It isn\\'t very sure of itself,\" she said cautiously . She was very\\nafraid that if Lawrence guessed what she was thinkin g he would\\nshut up. And she was right.\\n\"A lot of that is the aliens. Four hundred worlds o f them -- a\\nlot more than there were humans at the time of the Change,\\nthough we\\'ve outbred them all now.

As far as she co uld recall, she was\\na good ten years from needing it. Yet here she was,  adolescent and\\nbare. She stood up a little shakily, sounding out h er body. Her\\nmuscles weren\\'t developed. And all the natural bodi ly functions\\nfelt connected, at least for the time being.\\nThe Sun was high in a cloudless sky. She was in a li ttle\\nclearing, but after looking around she realized it was actually the\\nbottom of a fairly deep depression in the ground. I t didn\\'t seem to\\nbe natural, though Nature had taken it over. It was  rectangular.\\nAnd the perimeter was littered with flat slabs of r ock, some of\\nwhich still held a polish. She used one of these as  a mirror to\\ncheck her new appearance.\\nThe walls of the depression had once been vertical, but most\\nof them had collapsed and it wasn\\'t hard for her to  climb out. She\\ninspected the rock slabs and was surprised to find one with\\nwriting on it. It said:\\nExperimental Therapy Wing\\nExcept for the birds it was quiet; she seemed to be completely\\nalone. She startled a rabbit as she climbed out of the hole.\\nSomeone had put a lot of work into this world, for whatever\\nreason. Vegetation ran riot, with clearings of thig h-high grass\\nseparating widely spaced stands of straggly trees. It was very\\nunlike most of the worlds people had made for thems elves,\\nperhaps because it was so much like the real, pre-C hange Earth.\\nStumped for further clues, she picked the tallest t ree she\\ncould find and climbed it to get a look around. In the distance\\nthere were more rectangular holes. And perhaps a ki lometer\\naway, amid a small group of them, there was a human  being\\nsitting beneath another tree.\\nCaroline climbed down and scouted around the flat r ocks.\\nSome of them had been broken; she found a busted cor ner, a\\npiece of about a kilogram heft with a sharp edge. S he decided it\\nwould make an acceptable weapon if she needed one. Then she\\nwent to see who the other person was.\\nIt was a boy whose apparent youth matched her own, but as\\nCaroline knew that didn\\'t mean shit in Cyberspace. There was\\nsomething familiar about him. He was sitting cross-l egged, naked,\\nstaring transfixed at the pattern of shadows formed  by the leaves\\nof his tree.\\nShe didn\\'t hold the rock threateningly, but made su re he\\ncould see it if he looked at her. \"Who are you?\" sh e demanded.\\nHe looked up. His eyes were wide; he seemed to only half-see\\nher. He was shaking slightly, and his voice tremble d as he spoke.\\n\"Are you Caroline?\" he asked.\\nSlowly, she nodded.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n115 of 134 23/03/08 23:03\"It makes sense.

Look, we need to star t a fire\\nbefore it gets dark. Let\\'s collect some kindling.\"\\n\"How are we going to start a fire?\"\\nShe smiled. \"Lawrence, I\\'ve been dropped naked into strange\\nterritory more times than I can count, and you woul d be amazed  at\\nhow good I am at surviving. Or have you forgotten h ow your own\\nlittle Task Challenge started?\"\\nHe sat up. \"You mean you really think you can deal with this?\"\\nCaroline laughed. \"If I was alone, and if I was han dcuffed, and\\nif there were six or seven guys chasing me with nig ht-vision scopes\\nand rifles, then I might be a little worried. But r eally only if they\\nhad a helicopter too.\"\\nLawrence found it almost discouraging to see how smo othly\\nand effortlessly Caroline worked. She led him to a good source of\\nfuel and set him to gathering what he could while s he picked and\\nprepared a campsite. She arranged the kindling and used her rock\\nto sharpen a stick, which she set into a knot in on e of the fuel logs\\nand twirled rapidly between her hands. Friction gra dually heated\\nthe stick, until the barest ember glowed at its tip ; then she\\ncarefully fanned this and transferred it to the kin dling, which was\\nsoon blazing. The whole process took less than an ho ur, but he\\ndoubted if he would be able to do it himself with a ll the time in\\nthe world.\\n\"That was half-assed,\" Caroline confessed as they fed  the fire.\\n\"You really need calluses to do that, but I\\'m not g oing to bother\\ndeveloping them. Once we kill something and get som e sinew, I\\'ll\\nmake a fire bow.\"\\n\"Kill something?\"\\n\"A project for tomorrow. Meanwhile, there\\'s plenty we can\\neat.\" With the fire well-started and plenty of sunli ght remaining,\\nthey went gathering. Although a lot of the things C aroline pointed\\nout were pretty unappetizing, Lawrence had to admit that she was\\nright when she said damn near the entire forest was  edible. Since\\nas yet they had nothing to put their collections in , they tasted and\\nate as they walked, sampling dozens of different gr eens and nuts\\nand berries and, in Caroline\\'s case, not a few inse cts. She also\\npointed out some of the inedibles, so he\\'d be able to recognize\\nthem.\\nThe night sky was so dazzling that Lawrence thought h e\\nmight never go to sleep. He kept Caroline up for ho urs asking the\\nnames of constellations and stars, and how to read the important\\nmessages they held. In the night they heard wolves howling, and\\nCaroline had to spend some time convincing Lawrence predators\\nwere unlikely to take an interest in them. Finally she simply tookThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n118 of 134 23/03/08 23:03his mind off the problem by seducing him again, and  after\\nfucking they drifted off to sleep snuggled together  on the grass\\nbeside their fire.\\nDays passed.\\nBecause the weather was temperate Caroline gave clo thing\\nand shelter a low priority. They drifted away from C hipTec in\\nsearch of water, which Caroline insisted they would  need for a\\nvariety of purposes other than drinking. They found a stream on\\ntheir third day, and then Caroline finally went hun ting. Her skills\\nin that regard were downright scary; she had spotted  two rabbits\\nand beaned them with that simplest of all weapons, a rock hurled\\nwith deadly accuracy. There were also fish in the st ream, and\\nCaroline had fashioned a spear to catch them. She h ad shown him\\nthe trick of weaving thread from the fibers of cert ain plants, and\\nset him to work making fishing lines. She also used  some of the\\nthread to sew, using a needle made from a shard of bone.\\nLawrence was disappointed to hear that loincloths wo uld have\\nto wait, though; it was more important to make pouch es for\\nholding and carrying things, particularly liquids. He was surprised\\nto hear that water could be boiled over fire in suc h a rawhide bag.\\nCaroline hadn\\'t even gotten around to making a knif e yet, and\\ntheir situation had become pretty comfortable.\\nHe had learned what kind of firewood to gather, sev eral ways\\nto catch fish, and how to gut and cook a small anim al. Their next\\nmajor project would be to kill a large animal such as a deer, not so\\nmuch for the meat (though they would certainly pres erve and eat\\nit) as for the hide, from which they could make ser viceable\\nmoccasins and cover a small lean-to. It had already  rained on them\\nonce, not hard, and they had simply taken it as an opportunity to\\ntry the pleasant experiment of screwing in the rain . But eventually\\nthey would face a real storm, or at the very least winter would\\narrive, and Caroline was carefully getting them rea dy to face those\\nchallenges.\\nAfter only a week their activities had assumed a co mfortable\\nrhythm. Lawrence was content to let Caroline run the  show, doing\\nas he was told and learning what he could of her va st knowledge.\\nShe was recreating the entire surprisingly intricat e technology of\\nthe stone age, one step at a time. It was surprisin g how many\\nthings one took for granted until one had to make t hem from\\nscratch. The value of a needle and a few meters of t hread, for\\nexample, had taken on a significance Lawrence would have found\\nincomprehensible for most of his life.\\nLawrence watched her work in the firelight, carefull y shaping\\nthe tip of a fish spear into a barbed wooden hook. No matter what\\nshe did her hands moved with precision borne of lon g practice.\\nHad she not been thrown with him into this empty wo rld, heThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n119 of 134 23/03/08 23:03doubted if he would have lived more than a few days . But already\\nshe had taken him from the depths of despair to a k ind of\\ncontentment he had never even realized was possible . She had\\nshared with him her knowledge, her confidence, and her body,\\nand in return he had only offered his tentative sel f-pity. But now\\nhe was learning a new emotion, one he could not hon estly say he\\nhad ever experienced before. He was falling in love .\\nFalling.  He had once before felt something like this, but i t had\\nbeen a poisoned, narcissistic love, a love he had t hought was for\\nPrime Intellect but which had really been for his ow n sense of\\naccomplishment. Lawrence had not fallen  in love with Prime\\nIntellect; he had guided himself gently and reliably  into that state\\non the cushion of his own skill. Lawrence was fallin g in love with\\nCaroline, though. She was temperamental, strong, un predictable,\\nand in many ways dangerous. He never knew from one moment to\\nanother what she would do. He had no control over h er; was, in\\nfact, at her mercy for his very survival. And yet h e loved her, and\\nthis reckless out-of-control love was an entirely n ew thing to him.\\nCaroline caught his eyes and perhaps noticed the st range\\nlight there. \"Penny for your thoughts?\" she teased.\\n\"You mean a copper penny?\"\\nShe laughed, a beautiful sound. \"I guess not.\"\\n\"I was just wondering if there\\'s anything you aren\\' t good at.\"\\n\"I\\'m not much of a computer programmer,\" she laughe d, then\\nsighed when she saw his hurt expression. \"I didn\\'t mean it that\\nway. I\\'m sorry.\"\\n\"No, I guess I\\'ll get over it.\"\\n\"Actually there is something.\"\\n\"What?\"\\n\"I\\'ve never tattooed myself.\"\\nLawrence felt something cold seep through his system . \"I\\nthought all that was behind you.\"\\nShe looked at him and saw what was in his eyes -- wa s it fear\\nor concern? She put the spear aside and drew beside  him. \"Some\\nof it is behind me. No more Death stunts. This can b e a good life,\\nLawrence, and I want it to go on as long as possible . So don\\'t worry\\nabout that.\\n\"But I always had this fantasy. It went, if somehow  Prime\\nIntellect would disappear and everything would go b ack the way it\\nwas before, then I\\'d settle down and be like I was before.

When we g et our shit\\ntogether, which won\\'t take more than a couple of mo nths, I intend\\nto provision us and go somewhere.

I\\'m very good a t this\\nsort of thing, Lawrence. But yes, there would be ris k. It would be\\nwork. But that\\'s the point; it would be something to  do. I\\'ve been\\nthrough this before, Lawrence. Without something to do, life will\\nget stale. And I didn\\'t go through all the shit I\\'v e gone through to\\nbe bored.\"\\nCaroline\\'s intensity startled him. This was the Caro line he had\\nknown in Cyberspace, who had paddled around an enti re planet\\nsimply to make a point. Lawrence could not find the words to\\nargue with her, so he just said \"I guess you have a  point there.\"\\nShe snuggled up to him. \"I need parameters, Lawrence . I need\\nto be channeled. I\\'m very happy right now, because there are no\\nchoices. The road leads in only one direction. I\\'m a fraid that when\\nwe get to the choices, when the roads diverge, I\\'ll  lose this focus.\\nAnd it\\'s been so long...I don\\'t want to lose it.\"\\n\"You\\'ve lost me, Caroline. I don\\'t understand what you\\'re\\ntalking about.\"\\n\"Don\\'t worry about it.\" She kissed him, and they hu gged\\ntighter, and they spoke another language with their  bodies as the\\nfire crackled.\\nTHE FALL + 2 YEARS\\nThe Spring thaw had begun; soon it would be time to t ry\\ncrossing the first great natural barrier they would  face, the Rocky\\nMountains.\\nThey had migrated far north of Silicon Valley, perha ps as far\\nas Oregon, in the hopes of avoiding other barriers like the Grand\\nCanyon and the great southwestern desert. Their hope  was to\\ncross the mountains and set up camp for the winter in the eastern\\nfoothills, then move leisurely across the plains un til they entered\\nArkansas through the Ozark Mountains. Since neither  of them\\nremembered much detailed real-world geography, all their plans\\nwere tentative.\\nLawrence sat by the edge of Caroline\\'s chosen campsi te and\\nwatched her set up. He had long since learned to ma ke a\\nrudimentary camp, but Caroline preferred to do the work herself.The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n121 of 134 23/03/08 23:03Meanwhile, he went through his bone needles and bag s of\\npigment, preparing to do for Caroline the one thing  she had to\\ndepend on him for.\\nShe had decided that her motif for this lifetime wo uld be\\nbirds, and the first bird she would wear would be a  phoenix. Its\\noutline was nearly complete, a black tracing colore d with soot\\ncollected from smoky fires. The fierce bird reached for the sky, its\\nupturned beak just grazing her neck and its wingtip s grazing her\\nshoulders. In outline it resembled a bird of prey, but when\\nLawrence began to color it in he planned to use brig ht hues more\\nremniscent of songbirds. The flames of its rebirth e xploded from\\nthe base of her spine, dim outlines waiting for him  to find a better\\ngrade of red pigment. The clays he had tried so far had not been\\nbright enough in the small test lines he\\'d done.\\nLawrence privately thought the tattooing was nuts, b ut he\\nwould never tell Caroline that; she could probably t ell how he felt,\\nanyway. In any case he took his work very seriously , because what\\nhe was doing would become a permanent part, not jus t of a\\nperson, but of Caroline . And while he thought she was crazy in\\nmany ways, he also loved her dearly. If she wanted tattoos, he\\nwould give her tattoos. And they would be perfect; h e would\\naccept nothing less.\\nThe time and effort required to create such a large design\\nwere simply amazing. They would make camp and spend hours\\nwith the needle, Caroline stoically enduring its ja bs, and the result\\nwould be a few centimeters of black tracing or a ti ny patch of\\ncolor. But the ritual of marking her seemed to awak en a deep\\npassion in Caroline, and evenings that began with t he needle\\nnearly always ended with their most intense sex.\\n\"I\\'m ready,\" she announced. \"Are you?\"\\nHe nodded. She had spread out a deer hide beside th e fire;\\nnow she lay on her stomach so he could work on her back.\\nLawrence had begun to color in the phoenix\\'s wing ti ps; he was\\nworking down her back symmetrically, so the incompl ete design\\nwould be as attractive as possible. Although Caroli ne was silent\\nwhile he worked, he could feel her flinch each time  he jabbed her\\nwith the needle. Although they both invested the ti me, Caroline\\nwas the one who went through the pain.\\nAnd her reward, Lawrence mused, would be a design ov er\\nwhich she had no control, whose appearance she was trusting\\ntotally to him, and which she would take with her t o the grave. She\\nmight never even get to see it, unless some fortuit ous\\ncircumstance arranged two mirror-like surfaces prope rly. Anyone\\ncould see their face reflected in a pool of water, but getting a look\\nat your own back was a real challenge in a world wi thout glass or\\nmetal.\\n\"That\\'s enough for tonight. I want to get a look at it in betterThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n122 of 134 23/03/08 23:03light before I do any more.\" He put the needle in t he pigment bag\\nand put it with the others as Caroline turned over.  Lawrence was a\\ncautious tattooist, always conscious of the fact th at he couldn\\'t\\nundo what he was doing. But there was nothing cauti ous about\\ntheir fucking after the needles were put up.\\nLater still he pressed his ear to Caroline\\'s belly, listening for\\nthe second heartbeat. He couldn\\'t hear it yet, thou gh Caroline\\nassured him it was there. \"Do you think the tattoo work is good for\\nthe baby?\" he asked.\\n\"You\\'re not tattooing the baby,\" she said. \"If it m akes me feel\\njoy, then why shouldn\\'t it be good for her?\"\\n\"How do you know it\\'s a her?\"\\nCaroline laughed. \"Before I was a dried-up old crone  I had\\nenough children to know what it feels like, Lawrence . It\\'s a girl.\"\\nThat settled it in Lawrence\\'s mind: He\\'d seen enough o f\\nCaroline\\'s knowledge to know that you never bet aga inst her. But\\nhe was still a little surprised when the baby came,  and it really\\nwas a girl. By that time they had crossed the mount ains, and had\\ntaken temporary shelter in the mouth of a \"cave\" th at was really\\nthe ruin of an old mine.\\nCaroline knelt by their fire and waited, so that gr avity would\\nhelp her baby come. As the birth unfolded, Lawrence felt for the\\nfirst time how crushingly alone they were. If anyth ing went wrong,\\nthere was very little he could do about it. He felt  a brief panic,\\nwondering what he would do if by some catastrophe s he died in\\nchildbirth.\\nBut nothing went wrong, the baby dropped into Lawren ce\\'s\\nwaiting hands after only a few hours of labor, and both she and\\nCaroline emerged from the experience healthy. Lawren ce figured\\nthat Caroline\\'s general high state of health had a lot to do with\\nthat; she had not let her pregnancy slow them down u ntil it was\\ntime to actually settle in for the birth itself.\\nAs Caroline nursed and recovered, Lawrence explored the\\nmine for a short distance, and found a small yellow  pebble that\\namazingly turned out to be malleable. It was the fi rst metal they\\nhad encountered. They speculated that perhaps this s peck of gold\\nhad survived Prime Intellect\\'s cleanup because it ha d been\\nunderground.\\nIn any case, it was what inspired Caroline to name their baby\\ngirl Nugget.\\nTHE FALL + 4 YEARS\\nThe mountains had started as a low haze on the horiz on, then\\ngradually grown as they had moved on. Now they were  within\\nstriking distance, and Lawrence remembered the adven ture of\\ncrossing the Rockies, having to rappel down gorges w ithThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n123 of 134 23/03/08 23:03homemade rope and climb bare rock faces dozens of m eters high\\nwith his bare hands. Doing the same thing with a to ddler and a\\nnew baby would not be a pleasant undertaking.\\nBut Caroline assured him that there would be no suc h\\nproblems. \"Those are the Ozarks,\" she said. \"They\\'re dark, but\\npassable. I was born there, but I don\\'t want to sto p there. I want to\\ngo on to the Ouachitas.\"\\nThe new baby, a boy, had been born during their appr oach to\\nthe northern Ozark range, across the long-fallow fie lds of what\\nhad once been Kansas and Missouri. Because they coul d see the\\nmountains when he came, Caroline named him Ozark. N ugget was\\nnot yet old enough to walk, so they carried both ba bies on\\ncradleboards, a trick Caroline had learned in her s tudies of actual\\nNative Americans.\\nHer tattoo phoenix was complete, but Caroline had g one on to\\nask for a swallow on her thigh. Lawrence was convinc ed that she\\nwouldn\\'t stop until her body was completely covered , but it would\\ntake them many more years to accomplish that. Becau se the skin\\nwas more sensitive, it hurt more when he jabbed her  now. At times\\nshe had to bite down on a piece of leather to keep from yelling.\\nBut she always insisted that he keep working.\\n\"Did it take this long for your friend in Cyberspac e to tattoo\\nyou?\" he asked as he worked.\\n\"Fred used a knife. It\\'s faster but less exact. And  we didn\\'t\\nhave to do anything else.\"\\nRub, jab, jab. Rub, jab, jab. Wipe, test, fill in whe re it didn\\'t\\ntake. Caroline nursed Nugget for awhile as he worke d. Then she\\nlet the baby watch, becoming hypnotized by the repe titive activity\\nand finally falling asleep.\\n\"Don\\'t you sometimes wish you had him here to do th is\\ninstead of me?\"\\nTo his surprise Caroline laughed. \"What a thought! I f I\\'d\\nwoken up here and found Fred under that tree ... or  Palmer ... you\\nknow what I\\'d have done?\"\\n\"No idea.\"\\n\"I\\'d have killed them before they got the bright id ea to kill\\nme.\"\\nLawrence looked up, startled.\\n\"They weren\\'t very nice people in real life, Lawrence . I was\\nreal close to Fred, but only because it was Cybersp ace. There it\\nwas nothing but a sick game, and my friends were th e people sick\\nenough to make it interesting. But here ... it isn\\' t a game. What I\\ncalled love back there and what I call love here ha ve nothing to do\\nwith one another.\"\\n\"What do you call love here?\"\\n\"Lie back and find out,\" she teased. As Caroline rod e him he\\nlooked to the side and saw Nugget watching them, an d then heThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n124 of 134 23/03/08 23:03closed his eyes and let himself become lost in the feelings.\\nTHE FALL + 14 YEARS\\n\"It won\\'t be long now, Lawrence.\"\\nIt was the only argument they had ever had. But it had gone\\non for years.\\nThey had long since made their home on the ridge sep arating\\nWest Mountain and Music Mountain. It had been tempt ing to\\nsettle on Hot Springs Mountain itself, nearer to th e springs, but\\nsome instinct had told them that it wouldn\\'t be pro per to live on\\nsuch a unique spot. Besides, the ridge offered a nu mber of\\ndifferent nearby micro-climates supporting a wide v ariety of\\ngatherable plants and game.\\nWithin the vacuum that was once the town itself, be sides the\\nnegative impressions of long-disappeared buildings, a public\\nfountain had survived, because it had been made alm ost entirely\\nof cut stone. The mortar had gone but the stones rem ained in\\ntheir original positions. It was not hard to plug t he gaps with\\nwooden shims, which would expand to make a water-ti ght seal\\nwhen water was added, and to dig a channel guiding the spring\\'s\\nrunoff back onto the splash plate so that it could fill the basin. The\\nspring had a chance to cool some as it ran down the  mountain, so\\nthat the water temperature was suitable for a hot b ath; even in the\\ncoldest part of winter, the water emerging directly  from spring\\nheads was hot enough to scald.\\nThe man-made lakes which once surrounded the town ha d\\ndisappeared with still obvious violence, apparently  when the dams\\nrestraining them had simply ceased to exist. Floodw aters had cut\\ndeep gulleys in the valley lowlands, making them tr eacherous.\\nOccasionally they found arrowheads, which Caroline quietly\\nburied; she had not introduced the bow and arrow to her family,\\nand did not intend to. There were also a couple of C ivil War era\\nfortifications, complete with descriptive signage e ngraved in\\nstone. Whenever she passed one of these, Caroline m ade sure to\\ntake a few swings at the sign with the heaviest ava ilable rock; she\\nwanted them obliterated before her children learned  to read.\\nShe, of course, would never teach them such a ridic ulous\\nthing, but Lawrence was obstinate on the point and C aroline didn\\'t\\nthink it would do any harm. It would be forgotten i n a few\\ngenerations, since it served no purpose in their pr imitive lifestyle.\\nTo celebrate their arrival, Caroline had Lawrence wor k the\\ngold nugget into a short wire. She used it to pierc e her nose, and\\nthen bent it into a simple ring. After a while, Lawr ence even got\\nused to her wearing it all the time.\\nNugget and Ozark roamed freely, together and alone,\\nsometimes miles from home. From one of these expedi tions\\nNugget returned with an improbable prize, a tiny ic e-clear stoneThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n125 of 134 23/03/08 23:03which caught the sunlight and reflected it in brill iant flashes. It\\nwas a faceted diamond. Caroline told her daughter o nly that it was\\nexceedingly rare, letting her think it was somehow related to the\\nnatural quartz crystals which were all over the pla ce.\\nIn warm weather Nugget sometimes wore a loincloth, in\\nLawrence\\'s fashion, and sometimes went nude like her  mother.\\nOzark had adopted Lawrence\\'s more modest habits. The younger\\nchildren, male and female, went nude unless the wea ther required\\notherwise; Caroline refused to force them into modes ty, and they\\nhad demonstrated little inclination in that directi on. All of the\\nchildren had seen them having sex; Caroline insisted  that they\\nmake no effort to hide it. Fortunately, the kids se emed to accept\\ntheir explanation that they were \"playing an old pe oples\\' game.\"\\nExcept that Nugget would soon be ready to play it, too.\\n\"I can feel it. In a month or two, she\\'ll be a woma n. I haven\\'t\\nhidden it from her, you know; I\\'ve shown her my own period, and\\nshe knows what it\\'s for.\"\\n\"Of course, you never hide anything from the kids, except\\ntechnology.\"\\n\"How else would you do it? You want to make them fe el bad\\nabout themselves so they\\'ll look to stones and meta l for comfort?\"\\n\"Caroline...\"\\n\"You want them to maybe re-invent the wheel, then st eam,\\nthen...\"\\n\"Caroline, stop it.\"\\n\"You know where it leads.\"\\nLawrence sighed. \"She\\'s twelve years old.\"\\n\"She\\'s going to be a woman. We\\'ve gone at this from  every\\nangle. If you think we should try to start a commun ity, then we\\nhave to consider genetic diversity, breeding years. ..we have to\\nstart as soon as possible, and we have to get as ma ny combinations\\nas possible off of our limited gene pool.\"\\n\"We\\'ve gone over this a hundred times.\"\\n\"But soon you will have to do it.

You should also be thinking a bout Ozark;\\nbefore long it will be time to do something for him .\"\\n\"Do something to him, you mean,\" Lawrence said sullenly.\\n\"It\\'s the only way, Lawrence.\"\\nThey had argued about it for more than six years, bu t when\\nthe time came he found himself powerless to contrad ict Caroline\\'s\\nwill. Fortunately she had spoken with Nugget, so hi s daughter did\\nmost of the work for him just as Caroline had done most of the\\nwork all along. She explored his body with microsco pic\\nfascination, especially his cock which she carefull y teased erect.\\nThere was little really new for her in all this, sin ce she had seen\\nhim fucking Caroline plenty of times. He wouldn\\'t h ave been\\nsurprised, either, to learn she had already been ex perimentingThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n126 of 134 23/03/08 23:03with Ozark. What was new was that she was fertile, and so was he.\\nWorking slowly, Nugget completed their incestuous c oupling,\\nworking her way slowly down his cock just as Caroli ne had done\\nthat first time in California fourteen years earlie r. But while\\nNugget moved with her mother\\'s carefulness and deli beration, she\\ndid not possess Caroline\\'s amazing certitude. And s he was so\\nsmall, like a feather atop him, and her grip on his  cock so tight.\\nLawrence found himself responding to her despite his\\nreservations; his body was literally making up its o wn mind to go\\nalong.\\nWhen he came he yelled out loud. He was quite unpre pared\\nfor its intensity, as if he was a participant in so me primitive magic\\nritual which had unleashed a strange power in him. In a sense,\\nreflecting later, he would suppose that that was ex actly what had\\nhappened.\\nBut Nugget\\'s coming of age ritual wasn\\'t over yet. With a\\nbeatific smile, she brought his tattoo pigments. It  was this idea as\\nwell as Nugget\\'s age which had made him fight Carol ine so hard.\\nBut having already fucked his daughter he felt it p ointless to put\\nup further resistance. Nugget had already decided s he wanted a\\nfeather on her shoulder blade, in honor of her moth er\\'s bird\\ntattoos. At least it was a small and simple design,  the work of a\\nsingle sitting. Lawrence completed it as quickly as possible.\\nHaving covered nearly half of Caroline\\'s body by th is\\npainstaking method, it was impossible for Lawrence t o miss the\\ndifference in their reactions. Unlike her mother, Nu gget did not\\nseem to get excited by the discomfort of tattooing.  If anything, she\\ndrifted into a serene kind of calm and even stopped  flinching. As\\nhe worked, he realized what the difference was; for Caroline,\\ntattoos were a gateway to passion, but for Nugget, they would be\\nthe gateway to adulthood.\\nWhen he finished they stood to face each other in s ilence.\\nLike her mother, Nugget might not ever see her first  tattoo;\\nCaroline still hadn\\'t seen her phoenix. \"I don\\'t kn ow why this was\\nso hard for you, Father, but thank you for doing it .\"\\nHe smiled crookedly and touched her shoulder. \"You\\' re a\\nwoman now, Nugget. You should call me Lawrence.\"\\nAnd from that point on, she did.\\nTHE FALL + 42 YEARS\\nDeath always cast a solemn mood over the village; Oz ark had\\nlost his own second son, Limerick, to a fall from on e of the cliffs\\non the far side of West Mountain. In all their live s the funeral pyre\\natop Hot Springs Mountain had been built only four times. Besides\\nLimerick there had been two hunting accidents and a death in\\nchildbirth. The pyre was not used for the various st illbirths and\\nbabies that had to be sacrificed because there was no hope forThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n127 of 134 23/03/08 23:03their survival; these, as Mother Caroline had taught  them, had not\\never been human and it was wrong to grieve for them  in the same\\nway. Most of these were simply exposed and taken by  animals.\\nIt was Ozark\\'s first time to build the pyre. As Eld est Father of\\nthe group, the task had always fallen to Lawrence; bu t now Ozark\\nwas the Eldest Father, because this pyre was for Lawrence.\\nEven Limerick\\'s death had not caused Ozark to feel s uch\\ncrippling sorrow. If it had not been for the need t o do right by\\nFather Lawrence he thought he might just find a cave  and sit until\\nhe either starved or saw the vision that would heal  his pain.\\nOzark was not alone. Although the task of readying the pyre\\nwas supposed to be solitary, nearly everyone had tu rned out to\\nwatch him work. They stood back respectfully, observ ing the\\ninjunction against helping, but also watching his e very movement,\\nwatching the limp form atop the wooden frame, as if  Father\\nLawrence might display his obvious divinity one fina l time by\\nrising directly into the sky on his own rather than  waiting to ride\\nthe currents of the fire.\\nOf course Lawrence and Caroline had never attempted to\\nconvince their children that they were in any way d ifferent, but\\nany fool could see that they were. For one thing, w ho had been\\ntheir parents? For another, they knew things. No ma tter what\\nproblem cropped up, one or the other of them always  knew\\nsomething to do about it. And half that primal wisd om was now\\ngone.\\nMother Caroline was the last to arrive, waiting qui te properly\\nuntil all preparations were complete. She nodded, a nd Ozark\\nprepared the flame. It was not proper to use the of fspring of a\\nlife-giving flame such as the campfire to light the pyre; Ozark was\\nsupposed to light a new flame starting with the fir e bow. It was a\\nskill they all knew, and it took only a few minutes .\\nOzark had done his work well. The pyre went up fast.\\nThe flames absolved Ozark of his responsibility and he\\nstepped back among the crowd, where Nugget hugged h im. They\\nwatched Mother Caroline as the flames rose. She was  standing\\nperfectly still, determined to show her strength in  this painful\\nhour.\\nBut in the dancing light, they could easily see the  tears\\nrunning down her face. And as the pyre burned down,  she began\\nto simply cry.\\nNone of them had ever experienced this phenomenon b efore.\\nIt was almost as shocking to see Mother Caroline sh owing such a\\nweakness as it was to be facing the loss of Father Lawrence. As\\nthe pyre burned further her grief deepened, until s he sank to her\\nknees and wailed.\\nTentatively, Ozark approached her. She accepted his e mbrace\\nand cried into his shoulder, finding if not comfort  than at least theThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n128 of 134 23/03/08 23:03assurance that she was not alone in her grief.\\nBut she was alone, more alone than any of them coul d ever\\nknow. She had thought that her nearly six-century re ign as Queen\\nof the Death Jockeys and main consort of Fred the Ps ycho would\\nhave prepared her for nearly anything, but as black  smoke drifted\\ninto the darkening Arkansas sky she found that she had no\\ndefences against the blacker pain of her own grief.\\nTHE FALL + 73 YEARS\\nNugget had moved the birch bark pages from hiding p lace to\\nhiding place during her long life, selecting the fi rst hollow tree for\\nthis purpose when she was only eight years old. Som e of the barks\\nhad deteriorated -- even the amazing birch had its l imits -- and she\\nhad recopied her notes onto newer pages to preserve  them. Using\\nthe gift of writing, which she had learned from Fat her Lawrence,\\nshe had set about recording her parents\\' secrets, l ooking in her\\nstolen snatches of overheard conversation for the p attern which\\nwould explain where they had come from and what the ir purpose\\nhad been in coming to this place to raise their fam ily.\\nMostly what she had was words, scraps of language w hose\\nmeanings were completely unknown to her. She finger ed the bark,\\nremembering the sounds she had heard, usually whisp ered quietly\\nin the night when Caroline and Lawrence thought they  were alone.\\nSome had always carried an accusatory tone, as if t hey were\\nsomehow dirty:\\nTEKNOLIJEE\\nWAR\\nRADIO\\nTEEVEE\\nLEKTRISITEE\\nOthers had been conveyed in warmer, more urgent ton es,\\nusually as they discussed some problem or other tha t needed\\nsolving. Usually these discussions would end with so me relatively\\nsimple trick being revealed that diverted the strea m, removed the\\nstain, or whatever was called for, but sometimes th e discussions\\nwent on for long hours as various options were disc ussed, and\\nthese words were more often heard on Lawrence\\'s lips :\\nTRIGONOMEE TREE\\nKALKEWLUS\\nVAPOR POINT\\nSPESIFIK GRAVITEE\\nOKSIDISER\\nNugget often wondered what manner of tree the Trigon omee\\nwas, and what its useful properties might be. At le ast a tree wasThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n129 of 134 23/03/08 23:03something she could visualize; what, on the other ha nd, was a\\ngravitee, and how was a spesifik gravitee different  from any other\\nkind? Lawrence had never spoken of any other kind, a t least not\\nwithin earshot of Nugget.\\nThen there were the words concerning origins, which were\\nspoken with such loathing or sorrow that their impo rtance was\\ncrystal clear, if not their meanings:\\nSIBERSPASE\\nKOMPEWTER\\nCHANGE\\nPRIMINTELEKT\\nChange  was an ordinary enough word, but there was nothing\\nordinary about the way her parents said it when the y thought they\\nwere alone. Sometimes, when Caroline was very tired , she would\\ntalk of the \"World Before.\" She would never say muc h about it;\\nsomeone might say it was a shame they could not fin d game\\nwithout a long and tiring search, or kill a bear wi thout getting\\ndangerously close to it, and Caroline would mutter that \"that was\\nsomething for the World Before.\" Before what? Befor e the Change,\\nperhaps?\\nIn any case, she had to find out soon or never, bec ause\\nCaroline was dying. She had never quite been the sa me after\\nLawrence\\'s death, but she had still been active, eve n energetic.\\nShe just hadn\\'t taken such a direct role in the com munity\\'s\\nactivities. She had gradually loosened her grip, to  the point that\\nnow there were many youngsters who had never even m et her.\\nThen she had gotten slower and quieter, and lately i t had become\\nquite hard for her to walk up a difficult slope. Nu gget wasn\\'t so\\nyoung herself; she had already survived Ozark, who h ad died in his\\nsleep, and her youngest brother Pilgrim was fading f ast. He had\\nsome kind of condition which made his movements pai nful, and\\nfor which Mother Caroline\\'s wisdom had offered no h elp.\\nAnd now for two days she hadn\\'t eaten.\\n\"I have ripe blackberries,\" Nugget said as she appr oached\\nCaroline\\'s shelter. \"They will do you good.\"\\nCaroline looked at Nugget, and could see that Nugge t\\nsuspected. \"You know I have no need of those,\" she said softly.\\n\"My time is coming.\"\\nNugget was surprised how tiny and despairing her vo ice\\nsounded when she said, \"Why?\"\\nCaroline laughed, and coughed a little. \"I have to, \" she said.\\n\"It would be wrong to try and fight it.\"\\n\"Mother, I need to talk to you before you go.\"\\nCaroline smiled. \"About what, child, your birch tab lets?\"\\nNugget froze, her eyes wide.\\n\"I\\'ve known about those for more than fifty years. TheyThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n130 of 134 23/03/08 23:03seemed harmless enough, and your father and I figur ed that if\\nthey were the most you could make of our indiscreti ons, then we\\nweren\\'t doing too badly.\"\\n\"Fifty years,\" Nugget said numbly.\\n\"Your father was flattered. I thought we should con front you\\nwith them and tell you to stop, but it would have p robably caused\\nmore trouble than it was worth. I\\'ll make you a dea l, daughter.\\nHelp your old mother to the spring so I can take a hot bath, and I\\'ll\\ntell you a story. I\\'ll tell you a story about the W orld Before.\"\\nTears welled in Nugget\\'s eyes. \"Fifty years. You make  a fool of\\nme for my entire life, then...\"\\n\"You\\'re not a fool, daughter. I\\'ll tell you why we did it.\"\\n\"If I ... If I ...\" Nugget sobbed. \"If I help you d own, I\\'m not sure\\nyou\\'ll be able to make it back up the path.\"\\n\"I don\\'t think that will be a problem.\"\\nStill weeping, Nugget helped Caroline to her feet a nd down\\nthe first steps to the path to the old fountain.\\nThe hot water slipped around her like a velvet skin,  and\\nCaroline tried to slip into the past.\\n\"Daughter, do you have any idea how old I am?\"\\n\"I\\'m counted seventy-one solstices, so you must hav e seen at\\nleast eighty-five.\"\\n\"I am over seven hundred and seventy years old.\"\\nNugget sobbed louder. \"Please, mother, don\\'t tell me  lies at a\\ntime like this.\"\\n\"No lies, child. I lived a hundred and six years in  the World\\nBefore, and I was dying then as I am dying now. I d idn\\'t know it,\\nbut your father was working as I was dying. He was a great man.\\nThere has never been another like him, but he was no t perfect and\\nhe made one terrible mistake.\\n\"With the help of many thousands of other people, y our father\\nbuilt a vast and complicated thing. The word for it is on your\\ntablets; it was called a computer. That\\'s nothing but  a meaningless\\nword to you, and that\\'s all it needs to be. But of all the artisans\\nwho dedicated themselves to the making of the compu ter, your\\nfather was the most important, because he was the o ne that\\ntaught it to think. Without the others to help him Lawrence could\\nnot have made the computer, but without Lawrence, th e others\\ncould not have made it live; you have to remember th at.\"\\n\"Okay, Mother.\"\\n\"The computer could not disobey Lawrence, but he was afraid\\nother people would use it for bad purposes. So he t aught it to\\nanswer first to its own conscience, the conscience he had created\\nfor it. Then your father set it loose, confident tha t it was capable\\nof doing only good for the people of the World Befo re. Even\\nLawrence himself would not be able to make it contra dict itsThe Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n131 of 134 23/03/08 23:03nature.\"\\nShe paused, and Nugget prodded her. \"What happened? \"\\n\"The computer got a bright idea,\" Caroline said in a  sour\\nvoice. \"It figured out how to make people immortal.  So it made us\\nimmortal.\"\\n\"Just like that?\"\\n\"That was the least of its powers. It remade the wor ld. There\\nwas nothing we couldn\\'t have for the asking. There w as nothing\\nwe couldn\\'t do. Nothing could ever hurt us.\" She co ughed again.\\n\"It was fucking boring.\"\\nTheir eyes met.\\n\"It was the worst thing ever. Nothing mattered. Not  pain, not\\naccomplishments, not anything.\" Caroline touched on e of Nugget\\'s\\ntattoos, the small spiral which Ozark had tattooed above her right\\nbreast to celebrate their first coupling after his Vision Quest,\\nwhen they were finally both adults. \"After the Chan ge, the World\\nBefore became another of the words you overheard. C yberspace.\\nIn Cyberspace, all you\\'d have to do is make a wish and your tattoos\\nwould be gone.\"\\nInvoluntarily, Nugget put her hand over Caroline\\'s,  as if to\\ndefend the design.\\n\"Or you could move \\'em around. Get new ones -- it di dn\\'t take\\nany time, didn\\'t have to hurt. See? Nothing mattere d. I\\'ve worn\\nmany different sets of tattoos myself. But these ar e the ones that\\nmatter to me, because these are the ones I\\'ll die w ith. That was the\\nleast of it, of course. You could grow a few extra arms, turn\\nyourself into a bat, fly like a bird, whatever you wanted. But why\\nbother?\"\\n\"Mother...What happened then?\"\\n\"For almost six hundred years, nothing happened wor th\\nmentioning. Then, finally, your father and I killed it.\"\\n\"How? If it was so powerful, how could you kill it? \"\\n\"Your father built it, remember. He\\'d never designe d it to run\\nthe whole world, only to be a good helper. He knew its\\nweaknesses. So we were able to trick it, and it bro ke.\" She swept\\nher hand. \"Somehow we ended up here.\"\\nNugget dipped her hand in the hot water and splashe d her\\nface. None of this was what she had expected.\\n\"If you will do something else for me, I\\'ll tell yo u one more\\nthing.\"\\n\"What, Mother?\"\\n\"Promise me that you will give the birch barks to th e Eldest\\nFather to be burned with me. Those words belong to t he World\\nBefore. They may be harmless, but I\\'d rather not hav e your\\nfather\\'s only memory be those reminders of his wors t failure.\"\\n\"What will you tell me for promising this?\"\\n\"I\\'ll tell you the computer\\'s name.\"The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect: Chapter 1 http://www.kuro5hin.org /prime-intellect/mopiall.html\\n132 of 134 23/03/08 23:03She looked down. \"I\\'ll burn them, Mother. There\\'s no thing I\\ncan hope to learn from them now, anyway.\"\\n\"It was called Prime Intellect.\"\\nNugget nodded.\\n\"Now if you value the memory of your father, you wi ll never\\nrepeat that or any of your other words to anybody e lse. Let them\\ndie with me.\"\\n\"As you wish, Mother.\"\\n\"Then leave me alone to rest.\"\\nNugget didn\\'t have to ask for how long.\\nCaroline was too thin to float in the hot water, so  she let her\\nhead fall back on the hard stone fountain wall and looked up at\\nthe Sun.\\nIf she could somehow pull it off again, magically r ise from the\\nhealing waters as a young girl and return to her pe ople, she would\\ndo it. They needed her. There were so few of them, an d the\\nchallenges they faced so great, that their survival  was far from\\ncertain. One disease or natural disaster could wipe  them out.\\nBut that\\'s the way it was with things that mattered ; you never\\ngot to find out how they came out, if they were rea lly worth\\nanything. Caroline had done her part. She had made her decisions\\nand stood her ground. One day somebody would figure  out how to\\nuse the fire bow to launch arrows and how to make t hem fly true.\\nThen someone would shoot one at his brother. Carolin e had done\\nwhat she could to put that day as far as possible i n the future.\\nAs a result some of her children would die, because  in order\\nto hunt they would have to get close to their prey,  close enough\\nfor their prey to strike back. This playing God busi ness sure was a\\npain in the ass, Caroline thought. No wonder Lawrenc e had gone a\\nlittle loopy in Cyberspace.\\nBut he had been a good man. He had never approved o f\\nCaroline\\'s plan for their family, to act like some kind of snide\\nPrometheus who could  have given them the secrets of\\nmetalworking and gunpowder and steam power but who didn\\'t\\nbother because it was more amusing to make them str uggle in\\nstone-age savagery. Yet he had gone along, because h e already\\nknew the other way didn\\'t work. If this way didn\\'t work either,\\nwhat would it mean?\\nThe doubts and questions circled in her head endless ly,\\nchasing for an answer that would never come.
